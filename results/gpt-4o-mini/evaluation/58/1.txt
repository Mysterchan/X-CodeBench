Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly uses '*' to represent the value 1 and leaves the cell for value 0 blank, as specified in the natural-language description. All required elements of the heatmap are present. Full marks here. 25/25
Visual Fidelity: The geometry and color scheme of the Candidate Image closely match the Reference Image. The spacing and arrangement of the symbols are consistent with the original. 20/20
Text & Annotations: The annotation style appears correct as it shows '*' for 1, and there are no numeric values shown, which is in line with the specifications. However, there is no title or axis labels present, which might detract from clarity. 10/15
Style & Aesthetics: The colors and overall aesthetic are consistent with the Reference Image. However, some minor adjustments could enhance the visual appeal, such as better alignment of the annotations with the cells. 12/15
Data Faithfulness: The data displayed correctly represents the required symbols and groups. The heatmap reflects the underlying data faithfully. 15/15
Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code seems to effectively address the initial issue. It executes without errors, and the changes made directly impact the output positively. Good coding practices are visible. 10/10
Score: 92/100
