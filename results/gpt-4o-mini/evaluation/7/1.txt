Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes all the required plot elements, such as three data series denoted by different lines and markers. The series are correctly represented with appropriate legends. However, the description states that the markers are partially obstructed by the plot frame. Since the issue regarding the visibility of the markers is not fixed according to the specification, I will score it lower. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry, scaling, and overall layout of the Candidate Image closely resemble the Reference Image in terms of series representation. However, without adjusting the frame, the lines and markers are still partially obscured. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: All titles, legends, and labels in the Candidate Image are correct and consistent with the Reference Image. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The line colors, marker styles, and overall aesthetics of the Candidate Image match closely with the Reference Image. Subscore: 15/15

Data Faithfulness: The visualization accurately reflects the series trends and relationships as per the description, and the intended use of data appears correct. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code executes successfully with no syntax or runtime errors, and it appears that the necessary adjustments to the plot framing might not have been considered adequately, affecting the visibility of the plot markers. However, there are no extraneous elements or regressions noted. Subscore: 8/10

Score: 68/100
