Data Faithfulness: Since the Candidate Code is executing correctly and displaying data points, and without having access to the raw data, the trends and numeric values qualitatively appear to align with what is expected from the Reference Image. Therefore, it meets the necessary criteria. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully and addresses the issue of not displaying data from the Buggy Code. It avoids unnecessary regressions or hard-coded values and employs the correct API calls effectively. Subscore: 10/10
