Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not implement the specified minor tick locations correctly and includes additional ticks that should not be present, reflecting a misunderstanding of the requirements outlined in the Natural-Language Description. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The major ticks in the Candidate Image do not appear correctly according to the positions shown in the Reference Image. The alignment and spacing of ticks differ notably. Subscore: 8/20

Text & Annotations: There are no text elements (title, axis labels, etc.) present in either the Candidate Image or the Reference Image, but since they don't seem to be specified in the description, they are not penalized here. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The Candidate Image has a similar aesthetic style to the Reference Image. However, the major ticks are incorrect in location and visual fidelity. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The tick placement is not an accurate representation of data, showing incorrect positions which misrepresent the data layout as required. Subscore: 5/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code likely does not address the bug by correctly setting minor ticks without altering major ticks as intended. This affects functional correctness significantly. Additionally, there is no evidence of syntax or runtime errors. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 43/100
