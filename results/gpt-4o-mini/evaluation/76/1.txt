Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes the correct plot types (boxplot and swarmplot) and necessary elements such as the points representing player scores. However, it does not correctly implement the connecting lines between points representing the same player across different courts, which is a critical requirement. Therefore, the subscore is significantly affected. Subscore: 10/25.

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and positions of the elements (boxplot and points) are mostly accurate when compared to the Reference Image, but the absence of connecting lines detracts from the overall visualization. Subscore: 10/20.

Text & Annotations: The titles, axis labels, and legend titles are correct and appear as intended, providing necessary context for the visualization. Subscore: 15/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles of the points and boxes are consistent with the Reference Image, but the absence of the connecting lines is a major stylistic mismatch. Subscore: 8/15.

Data Faithfulness: The visualization correctly displays data points corresponding to player scores and wins, which aligns with the expected data representation. Subscore: 15/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code appears to run successfully and adheres to appropriate API calls. However, it fails to implement the critical connecting lines. Subscore: 5/10.

Score: 58/100
