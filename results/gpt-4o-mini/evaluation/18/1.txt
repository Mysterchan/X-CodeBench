Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not implement the "symlog" scale correctly for both axes as specified in the Natural-Language Description. The output appears to use a linear scale instead. Due to the critical missing plot type, the score is capped at 50. Subscore: 50
Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image does not appropriately reflect the expected positions of points based on the intended "symlog" scaling, leading to a different overall appearance compared to the Reference Image. Subscore: 5
Text & Annotations: The axes are labeled and display ticks, but the tick labels do not match the expected "symlog" scale behavior. Due to the missing "symlog" implementation, this impacts clarity. Subscore: 5
Style & Aesthetics: The color and marker style in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image; however, the overall layout is off due to the incorrect axis scaling. Subscore: 10
Data Faithfulness: The scatter plot does contain data points, likely from the same underlying data, but the way they are plotted does not reflect the intended scale, resulting in a mismatch. Subscore: 5
Code Quality & Repair Validity: Without proper functionality, the code cannot be considered well-repaired. The code must ensure the axes are set to "symlog," which it fails to do, leading to runtime errors in achieving the desired visual output. Subscore: 0
Score: 75
