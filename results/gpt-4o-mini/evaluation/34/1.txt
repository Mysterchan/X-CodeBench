Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not meet the requirement for a smooth line chart, as it still displays a jagged line connecting the data points. The expected smoothness is not achieved, resulting in a significant deviation from the Spec. Subscore: 5/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positions of the data points are correct, but the line connecting them is not smooth, which is a critical aspect of the visualization. The overall shape does not match the Reference Image. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The axes are labeled correctly with months, but there are no titles or additional annotations present. While the axis labels are correct, the lack of a title detracts from the overall completeness. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors of the lines and markers are inconsistent with the Reference Image. The line should be smooth and single-colored, but the Candidate Image uses two colors (orange for the line and blue for the markers), which does not match the expected style. Subscore: 5/15

Data Faithfulness: The data points appear to be plotted correctly, but the representation does not convey the intended smooth trend. The jagged line does not accurately reflect the underlying data trends as specified. Subscore: 10/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code does not successfully implement the necessary changes to create a smooth line chart. The code may execute without errors, but it fails to address the primary issue of the jagged line. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 45/100
