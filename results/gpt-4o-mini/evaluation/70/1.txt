Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly uses faceting by species and sex, producing the appropriate histograms. However, it fails to implement the requirement of having only the margin titles in red; both margin and main titles are displayed in red. This issue leads to a deduction of 10 points. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry and plotting. The scaling, axes ranges, and positions of the subplots are accurate, meeting the expectations set by the Reference Image. Subscore: 20/20

Text & Annotations: The annotations, including the titles for the margin and main titles, are mostly correct except for the styling of the margin titles, which should be red but are not. This again affects the overall evaluation of text fidelity. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The candidate maintains the correct color and style of the plots but again falls short due to the incorrect color of the titles. The overall aesthetics are visually consistent with the Reference, but this error affects the overall score. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The data displayed in the candidate visualization appears consistent with what would be expected from the given description and the Reference Image, indicating correct data selection and grouping. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully without any errors and attempts to correct the bug from the Buggy Code, although it does not fully achieve the intended outcome with respect to title coloring. The attempt is valid but incomplete. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 75/100
