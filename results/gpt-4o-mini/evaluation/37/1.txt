Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes the required arrow and the text label "U" next to it, fulfilling the primary requirement of the specification. However, the label's position is slightly off compared to the Reference Image. Subscore: 20/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely resembles the Reference Image in terms of the arrow's geometry and overall layout. However, the axes ranges differ slightly, which affects the visual fidelity. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: The text label "U" is present, but its positioning is not optimal, as it appears too close to the arrow rather than clearly next to it. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles are consistent with the Reference Image, but the label's placement detracts from the overall aesthetic. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The visualization accurately represents the intended data, with the arrow indicating the correct direction and the label corresponding to it. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully and addresses the bug of missing the text label. There are no apparent regressions or unnecessary code. Subscore: 10/10

Score: 80/100
