Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully displays the heatmap and includes the necessary x-axis for indicating statistical significance. However, the asterisks need to be added at the specified columns, which they currently are not. Thus, while the core functionality is present, the critical element of marking significant columns is missing. Subscore: 15/25.

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positions of the heatmap cells match the Reference Image well. The scaling is appropriate, but the x-axis at the top lacks the asterisks that are essential for visual fidelity. Subscore: 15/20.

Text & Annotations: The title "A" does not match any title or subtitle from the Natural-Language Specification. Furthermore, the lack of asterisk annotations for significance at the specified columns detracts from the completeness of text and annotations. Subscore: 6/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The color gradient and overall appearance of the heatmap are consistent with the Reference Image. The absence of asterisks, however, detracts from the aesthetic completeness, but the style is otherwise preserved well. Subscore: 12/15.

Data Faithfulness: The heatmap accurately represents the data provided, with a proper layout consistent with that described in the Specification. Despite the missing statistical significance markers, the data representation itself remains accurate. Subscore: 15/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The provided Candidate Code compiles and executes without issues, suggesting that any bugs in the Buggy Code were adequately addressed. However, it did not include the necessary functionality of adding the asterisks. Subscore: 6/10.

Score: 69/100
