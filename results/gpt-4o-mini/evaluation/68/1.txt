Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not meet the requirement that bars should extend toward the left side from the maximum value on the x-axis. Instead, they extend from zero to the left on the x-axis, which is incorrect according to the Spec. Therefore, it fails to fulfill the functional requirements. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry of the bars is correct in the sense that they display the intended categories, but their starting position and final extension were incorrect, as explained earlier. The expected output should have the bars right-aligned. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The labels for the bars (x1, x2, x3) are correctly placed on the left instead of the right, which does not match the required positioning according to the Natural-Language Description. The absence of the y-axis and title annotations also detracts from the overall clarity of the visualization. Subscore: 5/15

Style & Aesthetics: While the color and style of the bars are consistent with what is expected, the overall presentation lacks the intended layout (right-aligned), diminishing the aesthetic appeal. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The data appears to be represented with correct values but fails to demonstrate the intended numerical relationships and starting positions as established by the Spec. The alignment issue undermines data interpretation. Subscore: 8/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code had some basic structural issues, but it did not successfully implement the necessary fixes to move the bars to the correct starting positions or handle label placements effectively. It may have run without errors; however, it does not achieve the intended visual transformation. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 48/100
