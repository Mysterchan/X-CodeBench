Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully displays the kernel density estimate (KDE) in a joint plot as required. Both the plot and the vertical dashed line at x=0 are presented correctly. The modification fixes the previous bug related to the ax iterable issue. Full credit awarded. (25/25)

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image matches the Reference Image in terms of the overall geometry and positions of the contours, with the vertical line positioned correctly at x=0. The scaling of the axes is also accurate, matching the specified limits; however, it is worth noting that the contour lines are not perfectly aligned in their appearance with the reference image. (18/20)

Text & Annotations: The Candidate Image does not include axis labels or a title, which are expected in a well-documented plot. The absence of these elements leads to a lower score despite the plot functioning correctly in other aspects. (10/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The colors, line styles, and overall visual characteristics of the KDE lines match the Reference Image closely. However, there are variations in the density and presentation of the contours, which implies a minor stylistic mismatch. Still, the dashed line styling is consistent with the reference. (12/15)

Data Faithfulness: The visualization reflects the expected data characteristics as described in the spec, showing an accurate KDE representation. There is no indication of incorrect data handling or selection, keeping faithfulness intact. (15/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code successfully addresses the initial issues with the plot's execution and structure. The solution uses appropriate Seaborn functions, and the code runs without errors. The structure is clean, and the implemented fixes are valid. (10/10)

Score: 90/100
