Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully includes all required elements such as the bar plot, line plot overlay, and the table below it, as specified in the Natural-Language Description. The legend, which indicates the "Actual" and "Target" data series, is also correctly implemented. Full credit is awarded for including all required visual elements. Subscore: 25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry, relative positions, and scaling. The axes ranges and subplot arrangement are consistent, making it visually similar to the target. There are no significant discrepancies noted. Subscore: 20

Text & Annotations: The titles, subtitle, axis labels, and legend titles are appropriately shown, indicating both data series in the legend as required.
