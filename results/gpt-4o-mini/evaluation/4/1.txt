Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not meet the requirement for the y-limits, which should be set to (-300, 300) for all subplots. Instead, it incorrectly displays y-limits of (-200, 200). This is a critical issue that affects the overall functionality of the visualization. Subscore: 5/25

Visual Fidelity: The layout of the subplots is correct, and the relative positions are maintained. However, the incorrect y-limits detract from the visual fidelity. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The y-axis labels are correctly labeled as "axis 0" through "axis 3," which meets the specification. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The overall style of the subplots is consistent with the Reference Image, but the incorrect y-limits affect the aesthetic presentation. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: Since the y-limits are incorrect, the data representation does not faithfully reflect the intended values. Subscore: 5/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code appears to execute without syntax or runtime errors, but it fails to address the critical bug regarding y-limits. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 45/100
