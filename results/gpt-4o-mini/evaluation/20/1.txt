Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image displays titles, xlabel, and ylabel; however, there are garbled characters present in the title and labels, which are not displayed properly. This does not meet the specification's requirement for all text elements to render correctly. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: While the layout of the text elements resembles the Reference Image, the presence of garbled characters disrupts the intended visual quality. The relative positions are appropriate, but the text distortion negatively affects fidelity. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The title, xlabel, and ylabel in the Candidate Image do not render correctly and include garbled characters. The expectation was for all text elements to be accurate and complete without any distortion. Subscore: 5/15

Style & Aesthetics: The overall aesthetics are reasonably close to the Reference Image, but the corrupt text drastically undermines the overall presentation. This detracts from the visual appeal and consistency with the Reference Image. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: Since the issue primarily lies with text rendering and not with the data itself, data faithfulness is difficult to assess. It appears no incorrect data representations are present, but the focus is primarily on text, which is garbled. Subscore: 10/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code appears to run without syntax errors; however, it does not address the core issue related to text encoding that results in the garbled output. As a result, effective bug fixing is not achieved. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 50/100
