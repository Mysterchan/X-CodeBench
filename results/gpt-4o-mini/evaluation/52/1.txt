Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly includes the required elements of a confusion matrix, displaying all necessary values, including 1102 and 725 in full integer format. However, the heatmap does contain a title which is not specified in the original Natural-Language Description. While this does not detract from the functionality of the confusion matrix itself, it slightly deviates from the scope of the specification. Subscore: 20/25

Visual Fidelity: The visual arrangement, color gradient, and general format of the heatmap are consistent with the Reference Image. The positions of the values in each cell are correct and clearly visible. However, the title at the top of the Candidate Image does not appear in the Reference Image, which impacts its fidelity to the original. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: The numerical annotations within the cells are displayed correctly as 1102 and 725. However, the presence of the title "Confusion Matrix" is not aligned with the Reference Image, which did not include any titles. The x-axis and y-axis labels are appropriately labeled as "Predicted labels" and "True labels" respectively. Subscore: 12/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color scheme and overall aesthetics align closely with that of the Reference Image, including the color intensity used for the confusion matrix values. The grid and layout are appropriate. However, the addition of the title affects the consistency of the style and overall aesthetics, which deviates from the Reference Image. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The underlying data used in the heatmap appears to represent the confusion matrix accurately, with the correct counts displayed in each cell. The correct values have been annotated without issue. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to successfully repair the issues pertaining to the annotation format of the values within the confusion matrix cells. It executes without errors and meets the required functional specifications, with the exception of the added title which slightly alters its adherence to the specification. Subscore: 8/10

Score: 82/100
