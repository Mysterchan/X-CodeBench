Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image displays a bar plot as required, and all necessary plot elements are present. However, the requirement for rounded edges is not met; the bars remain rectangular without curvature. Due to this major missing functionality, I will cap the score here. Subscore: 5/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image visually resembles the Reference Image in terms of positioning, scaling, and axis ranges. The relative widths and lengths of the bars are consistent with the Reference Image. However, since the bars are not rounded as specified, the visual fidelity is compromised. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: The titles, axis labels, and category labels match what is shown in the Reference Image and are appropriate according to the Spec. Everything appears correct and complete. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color of the bars is consistent with the Reference Image, and there are no major stylistic mismatches. The arrangement of the legend and overall aesthetics are appropriate. Subscore: 15/15

Data Faithfulness: The data used in the Candidate Image appears to be correctly represented, matching the trends and counts that would be expected given the Visual Description, even if raw data is not available. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully without syntax or runtime errors. However, it fails to implement the necessary edge rounding functionality, although it does not introduce any unnecessary complexities or regressions. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 55/100
