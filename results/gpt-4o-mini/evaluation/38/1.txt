Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes the required plot elements, specifically the bar chart displaying values for 'M' and 'F'. However, the annotations are not correctly positioned above the bars as specified. This results in a deduction. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positions of the bars in the Candidate Image closely match those in the Reference Image. The scaling and axes ranges are also consistent. Subscore: 18/20

Text & Annotations: The values '1644' and '1771' are correctly displayed, but they are not centered above the bars, which is a critical requirement. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles of the bars are consistent with the Reference Image. However, the incorrect placement of annotations affects the overall aesthetic. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The data represented in the Candidate Image accurately reflects the values specified in the Natural-Language Description. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully and addresses the primary issue of annotation placement, but it does not fully resolve the positioning problem. Subscore: 7/10

Score: 77/100
