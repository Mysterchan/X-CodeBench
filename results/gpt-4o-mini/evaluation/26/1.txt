Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly features the plot elements as specified in the description, including the integral area shading and curve, along with appropriate axis labels. However, the y-axis label ‘Y’ still appears too close to the axis itself rather than being appropriately spaced, thus making it slightly less readable. Subscore: 20/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry and the overall layout; however, the y-axis label's positioning and the x-axis label's substantial gap from the axis are areas where visual fidelity could improve. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: The labels 'X' and 'Y' are correctly implemented, but the spacing is not as specified in the description. There are no errors in textual annotations like the integral notation. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles of the curve and shaded area are consistent with the Reference Image. However, the labeling issue slightly detracts from the overall aesthetics. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The visual representation appropriately shows the relationship as described, with no incorrect data selections or representations. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code appears to execute without errors and addresses the spacing issue to some extent. It likely uses proper API calls to format the labels as requested. Subscore: 8/10

Score: 80/100
