Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully displays a heatmap without a color bar as specified in the Natural-Language Description. All required elements of the heatmap are present. The score is full for this criterion. (25/25)

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry, relative positions, and scaling. The heatmap colors and overall layout are consistent with the Reference Image. However, there is a slight difference in the arrangement of colors, suggesting potential variations in the random data generation. (18/20)

Text & Annotations: There are no explicit titles, subtitles, or axis labels indicated by the Natural-Language Description. However, the axes are automatically labeled by their indices, which is standard for a heatmap. Since no specific textual elements were requested, this is adequate. (12/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The color scheme used in the Candidate Image is visually similar to that of the Reference Image, maintaining a similar range of colors. However, the presence of the color bar in the original buggy code was removed successfully, contributing positively to the aesthetics. Overall, the style aligns well with the Reference Image. (14/15)

Data Faithfulness: Since the heatmap is based on randomly generated data, it is difficult to assess the exact numerical trends or relationships. However, the overall impression of the heatmap matches the expected visual output for random data, satisfying the requirement. (14/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to repair the initial bug regarding the presence of the color bar effectively. It executes correctly without syntax or runtime errors, adhering to best practices in terms of code readability and structure. (10/10)

Score: 93/100
