Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes all required plot elements as specified in the Spec, including the boxplots for each day. However, while the median values are displayed on each box, the precision of the median values (i.e., the number of decimal places) is slightly different from what is shown in the Reference Image. Full credit cannot be awarded due to this precision mismatch. Subscore: 20/25.

Visual Fidelity: The overall geometry and relative positions of the boxplots in the Candidate Image closely mimic those in the Reference Image. The scaling and axes ranges also match well, with the data points being appropriately placed. Subscore: 18/20.

Text & Annotations: The boxplot displays appropriate axis labels and titles. However, the median values displayed differ slightly in terms of precision (i.e., the number of decimal places). Though this difference might not be major, it affects the overall accuracy. Subscore: 12/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles used in the Candidate Image match those in the Reference Image. The box fills and outlines appear consistent with what is provided in the Spec. There are no significant inconsistencies in the styling. Subscore: 15/15.

Data Faithfulness: The distributions shown in both images align closely, indicating that the data selections and aggregations reflect the original dataset accurately. There are no visible discrepancies in the trends or counts perceptible from the Candidate Image. Subscore: 15/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to execute correctly without errors, and it appropriately addresses the requirement to label median values. No regressions or unnecessary code artifacts are present, which reflects good coding practices. Subscore: 10/10.

Score: 90/100
