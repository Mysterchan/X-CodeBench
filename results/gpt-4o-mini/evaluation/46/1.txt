Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes the Z-axis, but it is not fully upright, which is a crucial requirement based on the Spec. The Z-axis label is also partially obstructed, which impacts visibility. Overall, the necessary elements are present, but the required positioning fails to align with the specification. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and scaling of both images are similar, but the tilt of the Z-axis in the Candidate Image deviates from the Reference Image. The positioning of the axes is not as precise, which affects the overall similarity. Subscore: 12/20

Text & Annotations: The titles, labels, and annotations in the Candidate Image are mostly correct; however, the Z-axis label is not fully visible, which detracts from the overall quality of the annotations. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color gradient and surface aesthetics in the Candidate and Reference Image are consistent, and the overall visual style is appealing. However, the failure to present the Z-axis fully upright affects stylistic coherence. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: There appears to be no issue with the integrity of the data represented in the Candidate Image. The surface plot shape remains consistent with what is expected, maintaining similar trends to the Reference Image. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code does not resolve the primary issue of the Z-axis tilt and the obstruction of its label effectively. While the code executes without errors, it does not correctly fix the identified problems in the Buggy Code. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 69/100
