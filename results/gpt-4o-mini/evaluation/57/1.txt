Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image effectively plots the points colored by the respective categories 'Y' and 'N', satisfying the requirement for both colors to be displayed. However, it does not visually represent the assertion that the blue point ('Y') should be above the gray point ('N'). While the colors are correct, the overall arrangement does not meet the intended display criteria. Thus, I will deduct points for not achieving the required graphical layering. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The positions of the points in the Candidate Image are identical to those in the Reference Image; however, they are displayed with the blue point visually on top as specified. The placement of points corresponds well with the provided geometry. Therefore, there is room for improvement regarding the correct visual representation of hierarchy rather than position. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: The titles, labels, and legend are correctly displayed with appropriate categories and placements, matching the Reference Image accurately. All text and annotations are clear and present. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles used in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image’s intention, including the color representation of 'Y' and 'N'. The presence of gridlines is appropriately considered. Thus, no penalties are necessary here. Subscore: 15/15

Data Faithfulness: The Candidate Image faithfully represents the intended data points, including the correct grouping by categories. The relationship between the gray and blue points is maintained. Therefore, there are no detected discrepancies in how the data is portrayed. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code is executable and does not contain syntax or runtime errors, meaning it successfully addresses the issues outlined in the Buggy Code. However, while it executes, the layering of the overlaps still needs addressing to meet the functional requirements stated. Thus, it does fix the problem but does not fully achieve the desired output. Subscore: 8/10

Score: 68/100
