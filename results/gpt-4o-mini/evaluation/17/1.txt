Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly displays a 3D scatter plot with points defined by x, y, and z coordinates, and incorporates the appropriate axis labels as specified in the Natural-Language Description. The z-axis label is now included, which satisfies the requirement for triplet identification. Subscore: 25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry, relative positioning of the points, and scaling of the axes. The layout and arrangement of the 3D scatter plot is consistent with the Reference Image. Subscore: 20

Text & Annotations: The axis labels are correct and complete—labeled as "X Label," "Y Label," and "Z Label." This meets the requirements set forth in the Spec. There are no additional titles or annotations specified, so the provided labels are appropriate. Subscore: 15

Style & Aesthetics: The color of the scatter plot points and the overall style of the plot conform to the Reference Image's aesthetic. The formatting in terms of grid presence and axis styles is consistent with what is shown in the Reference Image. Subscore: 15

Data Faithfulness: The visualization reflects the correct data representation as indicated in the Natural-Language Description. It accurately portrays the points in a 3D space without any evident distortions, and trends or relationships are qualitatively sound based on the plotted data. Subscore: 15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to effectively repair the Buggy Code by adding the necessary z-axis label and produces a successfully executable code in a standard environment. There are no unnecessary regressions or redundant code present, and it appears to utilize appropriate functions for 3D plotting. Subscore: 10

Score: 100
