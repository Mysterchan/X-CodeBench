Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image shows years as well as duplicate month indicators on the y-axis, which does not align with the specification of displaying only years. This results in a significant deviation from the required output. The score is capped due to this critical error. Subscore: 5/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely follows the layout and color scheme of the Reference Image, but since it includes incorrect labels (both years and months), the alignment is compromised. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The y-axis ticks include erroneous month labels (e.g., 'None'), which were not intended, thus failing to meet the specification. Apart from that, other text elements appear adequate. Subscore: 5/15

Style & Aesthetics: The overall color scheme, gradient, and arrangement appear to match the Reference Image well, despite the y-tick issue. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: Since the Candidate Image includes the incorrect month labels on the y-axis, the representation of data fails to convey the intended information accurately. Subscore: 5/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code does not effectively remove the month indicators, leading to a failure in execution based on the requirements. The execution raises issues regarding expected output consistency. Subscore: 2/10

Score: 39/100
