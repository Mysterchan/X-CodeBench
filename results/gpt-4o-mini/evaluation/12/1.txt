Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes a 3D vector plotted at the specified coordinates and correctness of the view angle; however, there are multiple points plotted instead of just one, which does not match the expectation of a single distinct point. This results in a loss of clarity regarding the specified vector, warranting a deduction. Subscore: 10/25.
Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positioning of elements are mostly accurate with respect to the Reference Image, but the extra points detract from its fidelity. Subscore: 10/20.
Text & Annotations: The axis labels are present and correctly labeled according to the Spec. However, the title or any additional annotations are not provided. Subscore: 12/15.
Style & Aesthetics: The color and style of the plotted points are consistent with the Reference Image; however, the use of multiple points instead of a single point is a significant mismatch in style intent, leading to a deduction. Subscore: 10/15.
Data Faithfulness: The Candidate Code accurately uses the intended data coordinates; however, plotting multiple points rather than a single vector does not represent the data accurately according to the Spec. Subscore: 10/15.
Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code appears to execute without errors. It addresses some aspects of the bug but does not fully resolve the core issue of plotting correct data points. Subscore: 7/10.
Score: 59/100
