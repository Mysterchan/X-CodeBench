Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image fails to reproduce the arrow with a clearly defined tip as specified. The arrow is drawn with a solid line and a blue color but lacks the filled tip shape shown in the Reference Image. The key visual element (the tip of the arrow) is missing, resulting in a significant misalignment with the Spec. Subscore: 5/25

Visual Fidelity: The scale and relative positions of the arrow in both images are generally consistent. However, due to the absence of a proper arrow tip in the Candidate Image, it does not match the visual fidelity of the Reference Image. The actual shape of the arrow does not resemble the one with a filled tip visible in the Reference Image, leading to a drop in score. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: There are no titles, subtitles, axis labels, or annotations provided in either image. However, since they were not specified in the Spec and both images have the default setup, this does not negatively impact the evaluation. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color of the arrow is markedly different between the Candidate and Reference Images; the Candidate Image uses blue, while the Reference Image uses a filled color distinct from just an outline. The absence of the filled tip and the color discrepancy lead to a lack of stylistic alignment. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The arrow direction and positioning in the Candidate Image do reflect the intended points (0, 1) to (1, 2). However, the lack of a proper arrow tip detracts from the data's visual representation. Subscore: 10/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code is executed without any errors and appears to be a valid attempt to address the issue. However, it does not successfully achieve the full requirements of the Spec as it does not create the arrow with a defined tip. The execution is correct, but the desired visual outcome is not achieved. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 50/100
