Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes a histogram with normally distributed data and an empty subplot with centered text, which meets the basic requirements of the Spec. However, the issue with misalignment of the text in the empty subplot is evident as it does not appear centered properly relative to the subplot region. Therefore, while the histogram is functional, the critical requirement of the text alignment is not satisfied, leading to a lower subscore.  Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and layout of the subplots in the Candidate Image largely match those in the Reference Image. However, the text in the empty subplot is not well-aligned due to the incorrect usage of `sharex`, which results in visual misalignment. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The titles and the text "TEST 10" in the empty subplot are correct. However, because of the alignment issue caused by the `sharex` setting, this criteria suffers. Thus, while the text content is acceptable, the execution does not fully meet expectations. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors, fills, and overall aesthetics of the histogram match the Reference Image, and the style of the text is consistent as well. However, due to the misalignment introduced by the subplot configuration, there is a penalty on this aspect as well. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The histogram accurately represents normally distributed data consistent with the narrative provided in the Spec. The absence of zero in the histogram appears to be the reason for the alignment issue rather than an erroneous data representation. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes without errors and attempts to fix the initial bug. However, it does not effectively resolve the subplot alignment issue related to the `sharex` constraint. Hence, while the code quality is decent, the resolution of the bug is insufficient. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 55/100
