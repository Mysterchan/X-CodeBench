Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully includes the heatmaps in a 2x2 grid and includes a unified colorbar, addressing the primary bug of having separate colorbars for each subplot. However, the colorbar placement is at the edge of the last subplot, which may not be ideally aligned with the typical representation of a unified colorbar for all subplots. Given that the fundamental requirement was met but the execution could be more optimal, I would assign a subscore of 20/25.
Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image is overall faithful to the Reference Image in terms of color usage and the heatmap's size; however, the position and alignment of the colorbar are off, leading to an altered perception of the plot arrangement. The visual output does not match the uniformity of the Reference Image. Therefore, I would assign a subscore of 12/20.
Text & Annotations: The colorbar label is present, but the specifics and formatting could be debated; it looks cluttered and somewhat awkward in position relative to the heatmaps. There are no titles or axis labels displayed, which reduces clarity. Overall, this aspect needs significant improvement. Subscore: 8/15.
Style & Aesthetics: The use of colors and styles is consistent with the Reference Image, and the heatmaps visually resemble the expected output. However, the alignment issues detract from overall aesthetics. I would assign a subscore of 10/15 due to minor issues in the presentation.
Data Faithfulness: While the data conveyed in the heatmaps matches the expected complexity and variation analogous to the Reference Image, the effective presentation diminishes this quality slightly due to the aforementioned colorbar misplacement. Therefore, the data representation is only partially aligned with the Specification. Subscore: 12/15.
Code Quality & Repair Validity: The candidate's code appears to execute without errors, and it effectively solves the issue of multiple colorbars. However, improvements in the colorbar handling could have been applied. Overall, the code is functional but could be refined. Subscore: 8/10.

Score: 70/100
