Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not fully implement the required diagonal line stretching from the bottom left to the top right of the heatmap. Instead, it appears truncated, and it fails to meet the specified visualization intent. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image displays a diagonal line, but it does not extend across the entire heatmap, making it visually misleading compared to the Reference Image. The line's placement is incorrect. Subscore: 5/20

Text & Annotations: There are no titles, subtitles, labels, or legends present in either the Candidate Image or the Reference Image. As this aspect appears to be related to the requested update of the diagonal line, it doesn't impact the score significantly but still shows a lack of consideration for annotations. Subscore: 5/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color scheme appears consistent with the Reference Image; however, the major issue with the diagonal line's length detracts significantly from the overall style and aesthetic coherence. Subscore: 8/15

Data Faithfulness: The heatmap appears to represent data correctly as per the description; however, the major issue with the line’s representation affects the perception of the data pattern. Subscore: 10/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code does execute without errors, but it does not adequately address the bug regarding the diagonal line's length. Therefore, while there are no syntax errors, the repair is not fully effective. Subscore: 4/10

Score: 42/100
