Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly displays the minimum and maximum labels on the y-axis, aligning with the specification. However, it still shows the y-axis line, which was not requested. This results in a partial fulfillment of the requirements. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of the plot's geometry and scaling. However, the presence of the y-axis line detracts from the overall fidelity. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: The y-axis labels for the minimum and maximum values are correctly displayed. There are no additional annotations or titles, which aligns with the specification. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and line styles are consistent with the Reference Image. However, the presence of the y-axis line is a stylistic mismatch. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The data representation appears to be faithful to the intended visualization, as the trends and values are accurately depicted. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully and addresses the main issue of displaying selective y-axis labels. However, it does not fully eliminate the y-axis line as required. Subscore: 7/10

Score: 67/100
