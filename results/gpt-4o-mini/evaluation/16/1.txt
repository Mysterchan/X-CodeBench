Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not successfully combine the stacked bar chart from `df1` and the line graph from `df2`. While it attempts to display both, the line graph is missing and the bar graph is rendered incorrectly, thus failing to represent the data correctly on the shared x-axis. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The candidate image has significant discrepancies in geometry and scaling compared to the Reference Image. The bars do not exhibit the expected stacked behavior and their colors do not align with the Reference Image. Additionally, the x-axis lacks appropriate date labeling. Subscore: 5/20

Text & Annotations: The title "Total Cyanobacteria" is present, which is correct; however, it lacks clarity in formatting and the x-axis labeling does not match the expected date format. The category labels for the stacked bars are not placed correctly or are missing, harming the overall readability. Subscore: 5/15

Style & Aesthetics: The use of colors in the Candidate Image does not resemble the colors of the categories in the Reference Image. The aesthetic attributes (e.g., line style for the overlay) are also not aligned with the Reference Image, and the overall layout appears cluttered without clear separation. Subscore: 5/15

Data Faithfulness: Due to the incorrect rendering of the bar chart and absent line graph, the visualization does not accurately reflect the relationships or quantities of the data as they appear in the Reference Image. Subscore: 5/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code has some issues, as the bug related to rendering the combined plots has not been adequately addressed. Moreover, the code is unclear in achieving its intended function without errors. Subscore: 3/10

Score: 33/100
