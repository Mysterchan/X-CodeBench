Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image displays the necessary heatmap matrix with appropriate color encodings for the values. However, the issue with the alignment of the axis tick labels has not been correctly addressed, with the y-axis labels still positioned too high and the x-axis labels still slightly off to the left. There are values present for all categories, but the alignment issue significantly affects clarity. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image largely resembles the Reference Image in terms of grid layout and color schemes, but the misalignment of tick labels affects the overall visual effect. The relative positioning and scaling of the squares was executed properly, meaning this aspect is mostly correct, but the misalignment detracts from the fidelity. Subscore: 12/20

Text & Annotations: The axis labels are correctly placed and match the Reference Image. However, the presence of incorrect positions for the tick labels affects clarity and overall effectiveness, indicating a lack of complete correctness. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors used are consistent with those in the Reference Image and visually pleasing, maintaining the expected styles for the different categories. There are minor visual distractions due to the misalignment, but in terms of color and visual aspects, it largely meets expectations. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The data values in the Candidate Image are accurate as compared to expected values and are presented faithfully. There is a clear representation of the relationship between categories, which adheres to the intended data representation. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code seems to execute without errors, and while the intent of the requested adjustments is clear, the adjustments to the axis labels were not sufficiently implemented, leading to reduced functionality. No unnecessary regressions are present, but the failure to correct the alignment issue is a significant oversight. Subscore: 6/10

Score: 60/100
