Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes both subplots, each displaying the respective plots generated by `my_plot_1` and `my_plot_2`. Therefore, it meets the functional requirements as specified. Subscore: 25/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry, relative positions, and scaling. The axes ranges are consistent, and the subplot arrangement is correct. Subscore: 20/20

Text & Annotations: There are no titles, subtitles, or axis labels present in either subplot. While the Spec did not explicitly mention these elements, their absence is noticeable when comparing to the Reference Image. Subscore: 5/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and line styles in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image. However, the lack of titles and labels detracts from the overall aesthetic. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The visualizations appear to accurately represent the data as intended, with trends and numeric relationships matching the Reference Image. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code successfully fixes the issue with the subplots and executes without errors. It avoids unnecessary regressions and uses appropriate API calls. Subscore: 10/10

Score: 85/100
