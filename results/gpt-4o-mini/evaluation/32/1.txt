Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not include the `ConnectionPatch` lines as specified in the Natural-Language Description. The absence of these lines means that the required plot elements are incomplete. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positions of the inset axes and main plot are not aligned correctly, and the connection lines are missing, which affects the overall fidelity to the Reference Image. Subscore: 5/20

Text & Annotations: There are no titles, axis labels, or legends present in the Candidate Image, which are essential for clarity and understanding. Subscore: 0/15

Style & Aesthetics: The Candidate Image lacks the expected visual elements, such as the connection lines and proper arrangement of the inset axes, leading to a significant mismatch in style and aesthetics compared to the Reference Image. Subscore: 5/15

Data Faithfulness: Since the Candidate Image does not display the required connection lines or any data points, it fails to represent the data faithfully as intended. Subscore: 0/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code does not execute successfully due to the missing connection lines, which indicates that the bug was not properly fixed. Subscore: 0/10

Score: 20/100
