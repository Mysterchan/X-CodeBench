Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly displays the y-axis labels, including 'init', and shows all eight states. However, it is missing the ninth state, which is a critical error. This results in a maximum score cap of 50. Subscore: 50/25
Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positions of the bars in the Candidate Image closely match those in the Reference Image. The scaling and axes ranges are also consistent. Subscore: 20/20
Text & Annotations: The y-axis label for 'init' is now present, but the last label appears empty, which is a significant issue. The other labels are correct and complete. Subscore: 10/15
Style & Aesthetics: The colors and overall aesthetics of the Candidate Image match the Reference Image well. There are no major stylistic mismatches. Subscore: 15/15
Data Faithfulness: The Candidate Image does not accurately represent the data, as it fails to include all nine states. This affects the overall data representation. Subscore: 10/15
Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully and addresses the missing label issue, but it does not resolve the missing state. Subscore: 5/10
Score: 90/100
