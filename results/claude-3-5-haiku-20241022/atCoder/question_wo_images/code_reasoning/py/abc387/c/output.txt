I need to trace through this code to find how many Snake numbers exist between 97 and 210.

A Snake number is a positive integer ≥ 10 where the first digit is strictly larger than all other digits.

The code computes `c(r) - c(l-1)` where `c(x)` counts Snake numbers from 10 up to and including x.

Let me trace `c(210)`:

**c(210):**
- x = 210, digits c = [2, 1, 0], n = 3
- ret = 0

First loop (i from 1 to n):
- i=1: ret += 2^(3-1-1) * min(2, 1) = 2^1 * 1 = 2. Since 2 > 1, continue.
- i=2: ret += 2^(3-1-2) * min(2, 0) = 2^0 * 0 = 0. Since 2 > 0, continue.
- i=3: ret += 1, break. ret = 3

Second loop (i from 0 to n-1):
- i=0: mx = 2-1 = 1. For j=1: ret += 1^(3-1-0) = 1^2 = 1. ret = 4
- i=1: mx = 9. For j in 1..9: ret += j^(3-1-1) = j^1 = j. Sum = 1+2+...+9 = 45. ret = 49
- i=2: mx = 9. For j in 1..9: ret += j^(3-1-2) = j^0 = 1. Sum = 9. ret = 58

c(210) = 58

**c(96):**
- x = 96, digits c = [9, 6], n = 2
- ret = 0

First loop:
- i=1: ret += 9^(2-1-1) * min(9, 6) = 9^0 * 6 = 6. Since 9 > 6, continue.
- i=2: ret += 1, break. ret = 7

Second loop:
- i=0: mx = 9-1 = 8. For j=1..8: ret += j^(2-1-0) = j^1 = j. Sum = 1+2+...+8 = 36. ret = 43
- i=1: mx = 9. For j=1..9: ret += j^(2-1-1) = j^0 = 1. Sum = 9. ret = 52

c(96) = 52

Answer: c(210) - c(96) = 58 - 52 = 6
