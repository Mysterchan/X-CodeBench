I need to simulate the execution of the given code with input `1`.

Let me trace through the code:

1. `x = int(input())` → `x = 1`
2. `ans = 0`
3. The nested loops iterate through all combinations where `i` ranges from 1 to 9 and `j` ranges from 1 to 9.

First, let me calculate the sum of ALL integers in the 9×9 multiplication table:
- For each `i` from 1 to 9 and each `j` from 1 to 9, we have `i*j`
- Total sum = Σ(i=1 to 9) Σ(j=1 to 9) i*j = (Σ(i=1 to 9) i) × (Σ(j=1 to 9) j) = 45 × 45 = 2025

Now, the code excludes cells where `i*j == x`, which is `i*j == 1`.
The only cell where `i*j = 1` is when `i=1` and `j=1`.

So we need to subtract 1 from the total sum:
`ans = 2025 - 1 = 2024`

Let me verify by tracing through the loops more carefully:
- When `i=1, j=1`: `1*1 = 1 == x`, so we skip (don't add)
- When `i=1, j=2`: `1*2 = 2 != 1`, so `ans += 2`
- When `i=1, j=3`: `1*3 = 3 != 1`, so `ans += 3`
- ... and so on for all other cells where `i*j != 1`

The sum of all 81 values is 2025, and we exclude only the cell where `i*j = 1`, which happens once (at i=1, j=1).

Therefore: `ans = 2025 - 1 = 2024`

2024
