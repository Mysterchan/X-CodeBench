Looking at this problem, I need to understand what makes X compatible with N:
- X XOR N = X mod N

Let me trace through the code logic:

The code finds all zero bit positions in N (up to the highest bit of N), then uses these positions to generate compatible numbers.

For a number X to be compatible:
- X XOR N = X mod N

The key insight: If N has k zero bits in positions less than or equal to the highest bit of N, we can generate 2^k compatible numbers by setting different combinations of those zero bits in N.

Let me trace through each test case:

**Test Case 1: N=2, K=1**
- N = 2 = binary 10
- Zero bits at positions: 0 (since bit 0 is 0)
- zero_bits = [0]
- K-1 = 0
- Check: 2^1 = 2 > 0 ✓ (enough compatible numbers exist)
- For i=0, b=0: (0 >> 0) & 1 = 0, so don't set bit 0
- Result: N = 2

**Test Case 2: N=2, K=2**
- N = 2 = binary 10
- zero_bits = [0]
- K-1 = 1
- Check: 2^1 = 2 > 1 ✓
- For i=0, b=0: (1 >> 0) & 1 = 1, so set bit 0
- N |= 1 << 0 → N = 2 | 1 = 3
- Result: N = 3

**Test Case 3: N=1, K=7**
- N = 1 = binary 1
- Zero bits: none (bit 0 is 1, and we stop at position 0 since 1<<1=2 > 1)
- zero_bits = []
- K-1 = 6
- Check: 2^0 = 1 <= 6, so print -1
- Result: -1

**Test Case 4: N=20250126, K=191**
- N = 20250126 in binary
- 20250126 = 0b1001101001001000000001110
- Need to find zero bit positions
- K-1 = 190
- Let me count zero bits in N up to bit 24 (since 2^25 > 20250126)
- Binary: 1001101001001000000001110
- Zero bits at positions: 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22
- That's 14 zero bits
- Check: 2^14 = 16384 > 190 ✓
- 190 in binary = 10111110
- Apply each bit of 190 to corresponding zero bit positions:
  - Set bits at positions where 190 has 1s: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 (of zero_bits list)
  - This corresponds to positions: 8,9,10,14,16,17,19
- N = 20250126 | (1<<8) | (1<<9) | (1<<10) | (1<<14) | (1<<16) | (1<<17) | (1<<19)
- = 20250126 | 256 | 512 | 1024 | 16384 | 65536 | 131072 | 524288
- = 20250126 | 739072 = 20989198

Let me verify: 20250126 | 739072
20250126 = ...1001101001001000000001110
739072   = ...0010110100111100000000000
Result   = ...1011111101111100000001110 = 20989198

Output:

2
3
-1
20989198
