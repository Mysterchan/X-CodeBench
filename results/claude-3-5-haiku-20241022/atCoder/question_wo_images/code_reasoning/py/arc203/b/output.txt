I need to trace through this code with the given input.

Let me analyze the `solve()` function and trace through each test case.

**Test Case 1:**
- n = 6
- a = [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
- b = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]

First check: `sum(a) != sum(b)`?
- sum(a) = 1+1+1+0+0+1 = 4
- sum(b) = 0+1+1+0+1+1 = 4
- They're equal, so continue

Second check: `sum(a) == 1`?
- sum(a) = 4, not 1, so go to else branch
- Print "Yes"

**Test Case 2:**
- n = 2
- a = [0, 0]
- b = [1, 0]

First check: `sum(a) != sum(b)`?
- sum(a) = 0
- sum(b) = 1
- They're not equal, so print "No" and return

**Test Case 3:**
- n = 3
- a = [1, 1, 1]
- b = [1, 1, 1]

First check: `sum(a) != sum(b)`?
- sum(a) = 3
- sum(b) = 3
- They're equal, so continue

Second check: `sum(a) == 1`?
- sum(a) = 3, not 1, so go to else branch
- Print "Yes"

Yes
No
Yes
