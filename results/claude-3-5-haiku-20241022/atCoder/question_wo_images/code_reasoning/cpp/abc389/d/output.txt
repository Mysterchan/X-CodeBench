I need to trace through this C++ code with input R = 2.

Let me understand what the code does:

1. It reads `n` (which is R = 2)
2. Initializes `i = 1`, `ans = 4*(n-1) + 1`, and `x = n`

Let's trace through:

**Initial values:**
- `n = 2`
- `i = 1`
- `ans = 4*(2-1) + 1 = 4*1 + 1 = 5`
- `x = 2`

**First iteration of outer while loop:**
- Check condition: `(2*i+1)*(2*i+1) + (2*1+1)*(2*1+1) > 4*n*n`
  - `(2*1+1)*(2*1+1) + (2*1+1)*(2*1+1) > 4*2*2`
  - `3*3 + 3*3 > 16`
  - `9 + 9 > 16`
  - `18 > 16` → TRUE
- So we **break** immediately

The outer while loop exits on the first iteration.

**Final output:**
- `ans = 5`

The program prints `5` followed by `endl`.
