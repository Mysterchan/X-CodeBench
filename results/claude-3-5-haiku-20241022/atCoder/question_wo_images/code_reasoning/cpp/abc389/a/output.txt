I need to trace through the execution of this C++ program with the input "3x8".

Let me follow the code step by step:

1. The program reads a string `S` from input: `S = "3x8"`

2. It extracts the first character and converts it to an integer:
   - `S[0]` is the character `'3'`
   - `S[0] - '0'` converts the character to its numeric value: `'3' - '0' = 3`
   - So `first = 3`

3. It extracts the third character and converts it to an integer:
   - `S[2]` is the character `'8'`
   - `S[2] - '0'` converts the character to its numeric value: `'8' - '0' = 8`
   - So `second = 8`

4. It calculates the product:
   - `result = first * second = 3 * 8 = 24`

5. It prints the result followed by a newline:
   - Output: `24`

24
