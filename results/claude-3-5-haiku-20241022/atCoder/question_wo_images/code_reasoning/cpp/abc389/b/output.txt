I need to trace through the execution of this C++ code with input `6`.

The code is finding N such that N! = X.

Let me trace through the algorithm:

**Initial state:**
- `x = 6`
- `ans = 1`

**Algorithm logic:**
The while loop continues while `x != 1`:
- Increment `ans`
- Divide `x` by `ans`

**Iteration 1:**
- `x = 6`, `x != 1` is true
- `ans++` → `ans = 2`
- `x /= ans` → `x = 6 / 2 = 3`

**Iteration 2:**
- `x = 3`, `x != 1` is true
- `ans++` → `ans = 3`
- `x /= ans` → `x = 3 / 3 = 1`

**Iteration 3:**
- `x = 1`, `x != 1` is false
- Loop exits

**Output:**
- `ans = 3`

Let me verify: 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ✓
