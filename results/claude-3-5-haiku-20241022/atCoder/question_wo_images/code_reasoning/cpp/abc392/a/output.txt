Looking at this problem, I need to determine if any permutation of the three numbers (3, 15, 5) can satisfy the equation B₁ × B₂ = B₃.

Let me trace through the code:
1. The program reads three integers: a=3, b=15, c=5
2. It checks three conditions:
   - Does a×b == c? → 3×15 == 5? → 45 == 5? → No
   - Does a×c == b? → 3×5 == 15? → 15 == 15? → Yes!
   
Since one condition is true (3×5 = 15), the program prints "Yes".

This makes sense because we can arrange the numbers as B = (3, 5, 15) where B₁ × B₂ = B₃ (3 × 5 = 15).

Yes
