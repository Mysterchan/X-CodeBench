Let me trace through the execution of this C++ program with the given input.

**Input:** `1 2 4 3 5`

**Step-by-step execution:**

1. The program reads 5 integers into vector `A`:
   - `A = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5}`

2. The program defines a vector of vectors `CHECK` containing these sequences:
   - `CHECK[0] = {2, 1, 3, 4, 5}` (swap positions 0-1 from sorted)
   - `CHECK[1] = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5}` (swap positions 1-2 from sorted)
   - `CHECK[2] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5}` (swap positions 2-3 from sorted)
   - `CHECK[3] = {1, 2, 3, 5, 4}` (swap positions 3-4 from sorted)

3. The program checks if `A` matches any sequence in `CHECK`:
   - Compare `A = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5}` with `CHECK[0] = {2, 1, 3, 4, 5}`: Not equal
   - Compare `A = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5}` with `CHECK[1] = {1, 3, 2, 4, 5}`: Not equal
   - Compare `A = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5}` with `CHECK[2] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5}`: **Equal!**
   - `flag = true`, break from loop

4. Since `flag` is `true`, the program outputs `"Yes"`

**Output:** Yes
