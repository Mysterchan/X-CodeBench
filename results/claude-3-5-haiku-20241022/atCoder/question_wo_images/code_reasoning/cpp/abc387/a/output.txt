Let me trace through this C++ program with the given input.

**Input:** 20 25

**Execution:**
1. Two integers `a` and `b` are declared
2. A `long long int` variable `result` is declared
3. `cin>>a>>b;` reads: `a = 20`, `b = 25`
4. `result = (a+b)*(a+b);` calculates: `result = (20+25)*(20+25) = 45*45 = 2025`
5. `cout<<result;` outputs the result

2025
