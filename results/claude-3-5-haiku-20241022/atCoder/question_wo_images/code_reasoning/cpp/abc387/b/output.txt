I need to trace through this C++ program with input X = 1.

Let me understand what the code does:
1. It reads an integer X (which is 1)
2. It creates a 9x9 grid where each cell at position (i,j) contains (i+1)×(j+1)
3. It sums all values in the grid that are NOT equal to X
4. It prints the sum

First, let me figure out what the 9×9 multiplication table contains:
- Row 0, Col 0: 1×1 = 1
- Row 0, Col 1: 1×2 = 2
- ... and so on up to
- Row 8, Col 8: 9×9 = 81

The sum of ALL 81 integers in a 9×9 multiplication table is:
Sum = (1+2+...+9) × (1+2+...+9) = 45 × 45 = 2025

Now, with X = 1, I need to subtract all occurrences of 1 from this total.

In the 9×9 multiplication table, where does 1 appear?
- Only at position (0,0): 1×1 = 1

So there is exactly 1 occurrence of the value 1 in the grid.

Therefore, the sum of integers that are NOT equal to 1 is:
2025 - 1 = 2024

Output: 2024
