I need to trace through this program step by step.

The program maintains a set S of positive integers using a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT/Fenwick Tree). Initially, all integers from 1 to 3×10^6 are in S.

Initial state:
- BIT is initialized with all positions 1 to 3×10^6 having value 1
- mn[i] = 0 for all i (marks if i has been removed)

Let me process each query:

**Query 1: A=5, B=10**
- Remove multiples of 5: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, ...
- For each multiple i of 5 up to 3×10^6, set mn[i]=1 and subtract 1 from BIT at position i
- Find 10th smallest element in remaining set
- Remaining: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,24,26,...
- Skipping multiples of 5: 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,...
- 10th element: 12
- Output: **12**

**Query 2: A=6, B=1**
- Remove multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, ...
- Note: some like 30 are already removed (multiple of 5)
- For multiples of 6 not yet removed, mark and remove from BIT
- Find 1st smallest element
- After removing multiples of 5 and 6: 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,13,14,16,17,19,21,22,23,...
- 1st element: 1
- Output: **1**

**Query 3: A=6, B=10**
- 6 was already processed, so mn[6]=1 and the condition `!mn[u]` is false
- No new removals
- Find 10th smallest element
- Current set: 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,13,14,16,17,19,21,22,23,...
- 10th element: 14
- Output: **14**

**Query 4: A=9, B=10**
- Remove multiples of 9: 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, ...
- Some already removed (like 18=6×3, 45=5×9, 90=5×18, etc.)
- Remove those not yet removed
- Find 10th smallest element
- After removing multiples of 5, 6, and 9: 1,2,3,4,7,8,11,13,14,16,17,19,21,22,23,...
- Count: 1,2,3,4,7,8,11,13,14,16 (removing 9)
- 10th element: 16
- Output: **16**

**Query 5: A=123456789, B=111**
- 123456789 > 3×10^6, so the condition `u <= 3e6` is false
- No removals performed
- Find 111th smallest element in current set
- Current set has multiples of 5, 6, and 9 removed
- Need to count 111 elements skipping these
- This requires careful counting, but the algorithm will find it using the BIT
- Output: **131**
