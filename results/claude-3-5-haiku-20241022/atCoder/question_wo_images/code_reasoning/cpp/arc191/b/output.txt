I need to trace through this C++ code to determine the output for the given input.

The code finds integers X that are compatible with N, where X XOR N = X mod N.

Let me analyze the algorithm:
1. For each test case, it reads N and K
2. It converts N to binary and finds the highest bit position p
3. It counts the number of 0 bits in N from position p down to 0 (num0)
4. If 2^num0 < K, it prints -1 (not enough compatible numbers)
5. Otherwise, it constructs the K-th smallest compatible number by:
   - Decrementing K by 1 (0-indexed)
   - Filling the 0-bit positions in N with the binary representation of K

Let me trace through each test case:

**Test case 1: N=2, K=1**
- b = 2 = binary 10
- p = 1 (highest bit)
- Count 0s from position 1 to 0: position 0 has a 0, so num0 = 1
- 2^1 = 2 >= 1, so we can proceed
- K = 1-1 = 0
- Fill 0-bit positions with binary of 0: position 0 gets 0
- b = 10 (binary) = 2
- Output: 2

**Test case 2: N=2, K=2**
- b = 2 = binary 10
- p = 1
- num0 = 1
- 2^1 = 2 >= 2, so we can proceed
- K = 2-1 = 1
- Fill 0-bit positions with binary of 1: position 0 gets 1
- b = 11 (binary) = 3
- Output: 3

**Test case 3: N=1, K=7**
- b = 1 = binary 1
- p = 0 (highest bit)
- Count 0s from position 0 to 0: position 0 has a 1, so num0 = 0
- 2^0 = 1 < 7
- Output: -1

**Test case 4: N=20250126, K=191**
- N = 20250126 in binary: 1001101001100000100010110
- p = 24 (highest bit position)
- Count 0s from position 24 down to 0:
  Positions with 0: 23,22,20,18,17,16,14,13,11,10,9,7,6,4,3 = 15 zeros
- num0 = 15
- 2^15 = 32768 >= 191, so we can proceed
- K = 191-1 = 190
- 190 in binary = 10111110
- Fill the 0-bit positions with bits of 190:
  - Starting from lowest 0-bit position, fill with bits of 190
  - Original: 1001101001100000100010110
  - 0-positions (bit 3,4,6,7,9,10,11,13,14,16,17,18,20,22,23)
  - 190 = 10111110 (8 bits)
  - Fill from right to left: positions 3,4,6,7,9,10,11,13 get 0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0
  - Remaining positions 14,16,17,18,20,22,23 get 1,0,0,0,0,0,0
- Result: 1001101011111110101111110
- Converting to decimal: 20251134

Output:

2
3
-1
20251134
