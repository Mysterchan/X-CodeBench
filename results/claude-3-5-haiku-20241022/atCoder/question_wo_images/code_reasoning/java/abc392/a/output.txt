Let me trace through the code with the given input.

Input: `3 15 5`

The code reads three integers:
- `a = 3`
- `b = 15`
- `c = 5`

Then it checks three conditions:
1. `a * b == c` → `3 * 15 == 5` → `45 == 5` → `false`
2. `a * c == b` → `3 * 5 == 15` → `15 == 15` → `true`
3. `b * c == a` → `15 * 5 == 3` → `75 == 3` → `false`

Since the second condition is true (we can arrange the permutation as B = (3, 5, 15) where 3 × 5 = 15), the output is:

Yes
