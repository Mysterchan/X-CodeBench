Looking at this problem, I need to trace through the code execution step by step.

**Initial Input:**
- N = 4, D = 3
- Snake 1: T₁ = 3, L₁ = 3
- Snake 2: T₂ = 5, L₂ = 1
- Snake 3: T₃ = 2, L₃ = 4
- Snake 4: T₄ = 1, L₄ = 10

The code loops through k = 1 to D = 3, and for each k, finds the maximum weight among all snakes when their lengths are increased by k.

**For k = 1:**
- Snake 1: newLength = 3 + 1 = 4, weight = 3 × 4 = 12
- Snake 2: newLength = 1 + 1 = 2, weight = 5 × 2 = 10
- Snake 3: newLength = 4 + 1 = 5, weight = 2 × 5 = 10
- Snake 4: newLength = 10 + 1 = 11, weight = 1 × 11 = 11

Maximum weight = 12

**For k = 2:**
- Snake 1: newLength = 3 + 2 = 5, weight = 3 × 5 = 15
- Snake 2: newLength = 1 + 2 = 3, weight = 5 × 3 = 15
- Snake 3: newLength = 4 + 2 = 6, weight = 2 × 6 = 12
- Snake 4: newLength = 10 + 2 = 12, weight = 1 × 12 = 12

Maximum weight = 15

**For k = 3:**
- Snake 1: newLength = 3 + 3 = 6, weight = 3 × 6 = 18
- Snake 2: newLength = 1 + 3 = 4, weight = 5 × 4 = 20
- Snake 3: newLength = 4 + 3 = 7, weight = 2 × 7 = 14
- Snake 4: newLength = 10 + 3 = 13, weight = 1 × 13 = 13

Maximum weight = 20

12
15
20
