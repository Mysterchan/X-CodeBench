I need to trace through this Java code with input R = 2.

Let me understand what the code does:
1. It reads an integer `r` (which is 2)
2. It loops from `i = 1` to `i < r` (so just i = 1)
3. For each i, it calculates:
   - `y = i + 0.5`
   - `x = sqrt(r² - y²)`
   - Adds `(int)(x + 0.5)` to sum (this is rounding to nearest integer)
4. Finally prints `sum * 4 + 1`

Let me trace through with R = 2:

**Iteration i = 1:**
- `y = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5`
- `x = sqrt(2² - 1.5²) = sqrt(4 - 2.25) = sqrt(1.75) ≈ 1.3228...`
- `(int)(x + 0.5) = (int)(1.3228... + 0.5) = (int)(1.8228...) = 1`
- `sum = 0 + 1 = 1`

**After the loop:**
- `sum = 1`
- Output: `sum * 4 + 1 = 1 * 4 + 1 = 5`
