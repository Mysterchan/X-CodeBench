Let me trace through the execution of this Java program with the input `3x8`.

1. The program reads the string `S = "3x8"`

2. It extracts the first character: `firstChar = '3'`

3. It extracts the third character (index 2): `thirdChar = '8'`

4. It converts the first character to an integer:
   - `n1 = '3' - '0' = 51 - 48 = 3`

5. It converts the third character to an integer:
   - `n2 = '8' - '0' = 56 - 48 = 8`

6. It calculates and prints the product:
   - `n1 * n2 = 3 * 8 = 24`
