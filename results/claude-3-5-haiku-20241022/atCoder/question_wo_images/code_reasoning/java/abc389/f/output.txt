Looking at this problem, I need to trace through the execution of the code with the given input.

**Input:**
- N = 5 contests
- Contest ranges: [1,5], [1,3], [3,6], [2,4], [4,7]
- Q = 3 queries
- Query values: X = 3, X = 2, X = 5

**Understanding the algorithm:**
The code uses a segment tree where each position represents an initial rating. The tree tracks how each initial rating transforms after all contests.

Initially, position i maps to value i (rating i stays at i with no contests).

For each contest [L, R]:
- Find positions whose current values are in range [L, R]
- Increment those positions by 1 (rating increases by 1)

**Tracing through contests:**

**Initial state:** Position i → value i

**Contest 1: [1, 5]**
- Find positions where value ∈ [1, 5]: positions 1-5
- Add 1 to positions 1-5
- Now: pos 1→2, pos 2→3, pos 3→4, pos 4→5, pos 5→6, pos 6→6, ...

**Contest 2: [1, 3]**
- Find positions where value ∈ [1, 3]: positions 1-2 (values 2,3)
- Add 1 to positions 1-2
- Now: pos 1→3, pos 2→4, pos 3→4, pos 4→5, pos 5→6, ...

**Contest 3: [3, 6]**
- Find positions where value ∈ [3, 6]: positions 1-5 (values 3,4,4,5,6)
- Add 1 to positions 1-5
- Now: pos 1→4, pos 2→5, pos 3→5, pos 4→6, pos 5→7, ...

**Contest 4: [2, 4]**
- Find positions where value ∈ [2, 4]: positions 1-3 (values 4,5,5) - Wait, none match [2,4]
- Actually checking: pos 1 has value 4 (in range), pos 2 has value 5 (not in range)
- Only position 1 has value in [2,4]? No, value 4 is in [2,4].
- Let me recalculate: positions with values in [2,4] are positions where current value ≤ 4 and ≥ 2
- Position 1: value 4 ✓
- Positions 2-5: values 5,5,6,7 ✗
- Add 1 to position 1
- Now: pos 1→5, pos 2→5, pos 3→5, pos 4→6, pos 5→7, ...

**Contest 5: [4, 7]**
- Find positions where value ∈ [4, 7]: positions 1-5 (values 5,5,5,6,7)
- Add 1 to positions 1-5
- Now: pos 1→6, pos 2→6, pos 3→6, pos 4→7, pos 5→8, ...

**Queries:**
- Query X=3: point_query(3) = 6
- Query X=2: point_query(2) = 6
- Query X=5: point_query(5) = 8
