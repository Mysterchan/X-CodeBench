Let me trace through the execution of this Java program with input `6`.

**Initial state:**
- `X = 6`
- `N = 1`

**Loop execution:**

The loop continues while `X > 1`:

**Iteration 1:**
- `X = 6 > 1`, so enter loop
- `N++` → `N = 2`
- `X = X / N` → `X = 6 / 2 = 3`

**Iteration 2:**
- `X = 3 > 1`, so continue loop
- `N++` → `N = 3`
- `X = X / N` → `X = 3 / 3 = 1`

**Iteration 3:**
- `X = 1`, which is NOT > 1, so exit loop

**Output:**
- Print `N`, which is `3`

This makes sense because 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6, which matches the input.
