Let me trace through the execution of this Java program with the input "N".

1. The program creates a HashMap called `opposites` that maps each direction to its opposite:
   - "N" → "S"
   - "S" → "N"
   - "E" → "W"
   - "W" → "E"
   - "NE" → "SW"
   - "SW" → "NE"
   - "NW" → "SE"
   - "SE" → "NW"

2. It reads the input string using `Scanner.next()`, which reads "N"

3. It looks up "N" in the `opposites` map using `opposites.get("N")`

4. The map returns "S" (since North's opposite is South)

5. It prints "S"

S
