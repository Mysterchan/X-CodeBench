Let me trace through this program step by step.

The program creates a 9×9 multiplication table and sums all values that are NOT equal to X.

Given input: X = 1

First, I need to understand what the 9×9 multiplication table contains:
- Row 1: 1×1=1, 1×2=2, 1×3=3, ..., 1×9=9
- Row 2: 2×1=2, 2×2=4, 2×3=6, ..., 2×9=18
- And so on...

The program:
1. Reads X = 1
2. Iterates through i from 1 to 9 and j from 1 to 9
3. For each cell, calculates cellValue = i × j
4. If cellValue ≠ X (i.e., cellValue ≠ 1), adds it to totalSum

Let me calculate the sum of ALL values in the 9×9 table first:
Sum = Σ(i=1 to 9) Σ(j=1 to 9) i×j
    = Σ(i=1 to 9) i × Σ(j=1 to 9) j
    = (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) × (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9)
    = 45 × 45
    = 2025

Now, X = 1 appears in the table only at position (1,1) where 1×1=1.

So the sum of all values except X = 1 is:
totalSum = 2025 - 1 = 2024
