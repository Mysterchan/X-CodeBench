Looking at the buggy code, I need to identify the logical errors:

1. When input is 'W', it appends 'W' (should be 'E')
2. When input is 'E', it appends 'W' (correct)

So the bug is that West ('W') is not being flipped to East ('E').

Let me find a minimal test case that exposes this bug:

**W**

This test case:
- Input: W
- Expected output: E (opposite of West is East)
- Buggy output: W (because the code incorrectly appends 'W' when it sees 'W')

This is minimal and clearly demonstrates the bug.
