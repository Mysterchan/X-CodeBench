Explanation:
- The buggy code initializes count90=1, count180=2, count270=3 instead of 0, causing incorrect minimal operation calculation.
- This minimal 2x2 test case triggers the bug because the minimal flips after rotation are miscounted due to wrong initial values.
- A correct solution would output 2, but the buggy code outputs a wrong minimal count.
