    # Check if the distance can be reached exactly after n moves with given distances
    # Conditions:
    # 1) The total sum of moves must be at least the distance between p and q
    # 2) The difference between total sum and distance must be even (because we can "zigzag" to adjust)
    #    Actually, since we can move in any direction, the parity condition is not needed.
    #    But we must check if the distance is not greater than sum and not less than abs(sum - 2*min_possible)
    #    Here, since we can move in any direction, the only condition is:
    #    dist <= s and (s - dist) is even or not? Actually, no parity condition is needed.
    #    Because we can move in any direction, the only condition is dist <= s and dist >= |s - 2*some subset sum|
