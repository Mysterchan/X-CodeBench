    # Check if the total length s can reach dist
    # Conditions:
    # 1. s >= dist (enough total length to reach)
    # 2. (s - dist) is even or can be adjusted by moving around (since we can move in any direction)
    # Actually, since we can move in any direction, the parity condition is:
    # The difference s - dist must be >= 0 and the difference must be even or zero in terms of length?
    # But here, since distances are real numbers, parity doesn't matter.
    # The only condition is s >= dist and (s - dist) can be "adjusted" by moving in other directions.
    # Actually, the problem is geometric: can we reach q from p by moving exactly a_i distances in any directions?
    # The necessary and sufficient condition is:
    # dist <= s and (s - dist) is even or zero? No parity here because distances are real numbers.
    # The only condition is dist <= s and (s - dist) can be any non-negative real number.
    # But since we can move in any direction, the difference s - dist can be "wasted" by moving in circles.
    # So the only condition is dist <= s and (s - dist) is >= 0 and (s - dist) can be any real number.
    # But the problem states distances are fixed, so the only condition is dist <= s and (s - dist) is even or zero?
    # No parity needed, because distances are real numbers.
    # But the problem is discrete steps with fixed distances, so the only condition is dist <= s and (s - dist) is even or zero?
    # Actually, the problem is continuous Euclidean plane, so the parity condition does not apply.
    # The only condition is dist <= s and (s - dist) is even or zero? No.
    # The problem reduces to: can we form a polygonal chain with edges a_i that starts at p and ends at q?
    # The necessary and sufficient condition is:
    # dist <= s and (s - dist) is even or zero? No parity needed.
