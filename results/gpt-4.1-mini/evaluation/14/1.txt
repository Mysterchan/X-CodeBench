Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully depicts the scatter plot with outlined circles as specified in the Natural-Language Description. All required plot elements are present, and the circles appear correctly without filled colors. However, the axes limits in the Candidate Image do not match the Reference Image, specifically the lower limit on the y-axis which appears to extend to -3. This leads to a reduced subscore. Subscore: 20/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image matches the Reference Image closely in terms of the distribution and placement of the circles. However, the y-axis scale is slightly off, as indicated earlier. The overall geometry and scaling are effective and mostly accurate, resulting in a slightly lowered score for this criterion. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: Since no titles, subtitles, or axis labels are provided, and these elements were not mentioned in the Spec, they are acceptable in this context. Therefore, the plot fulfills this requirement adequately but lacks any annotations to enhance understanding. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The Candidate Image is rendered in black and white, consistent with the Reference Image. The plot background and marker styles align well, though there is little distinct visual complexity or variation to consider for further aesthetic appeal. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The data points appear to be accurately represented in both the Reference and Candidate Images. The scatter plot correctly depicts the distribution without any evident anomalies, supporting a good faithfulness to the original dataset. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes without syntax or runtime errors and reasonably addresses the problem of displaying empty circles as specified in the Description. However, without access to the original Buggy Code, it's difficult to assess the full extent of the repair without more context. Still, it seems effective in fixing the marker display issues. Subscore: 8/10

Score: 80/100
