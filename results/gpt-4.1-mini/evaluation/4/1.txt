Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image fails to meet the specified y-limits of (-300, 300) for all subplots, only showing (-200, 200) instead. This is a critical error as it directly affects the functionality of the visualization. Therefore, I have capped the score for this criterion. Subscore: 5/25
Visual Fidelity: The layout of the subplots appears correct as they correspond to the intended structure. However, due to the incorrect y-limits, the visual fidelity in terms of y-axis representation is compromised. Subscore: 10/20
Text & Annotations: The subplot labels "axis 0" through "axis 3" are correctly labeled in the Candidate Image, so all text and annotations are complete as per the Spec. Subscore: 15/15 
Style & Aesthetics: The overall style and aesthetics match the expectation as the arrangement and formats are consistent with the Reference Image. Subscore: 15/15 
Data Faithfulness: There is no data visible in the Candidate Image for evaluation. However, since each subplot is intended to be blank, data faithfulness isn't assessable beyond confirming the absence of erroneous data. Still, the incorrect y-limits prevent a proper evaluation, but this is mainly tied to the correctness of the plot limits, which will reflect on the other criteria. Subscore: 10/15 
Code Quality & Repair Validity: It is unclear without seeing the actual code if the necessary changes to enable the correct y-limits were made. Assuming the concept of setting y-limits was attempted, the failure to implement this correctly affects the validity. Thus, I am giving a low score here due to possible issues in execution. Subscore: 3/10 
Score: 53/100
