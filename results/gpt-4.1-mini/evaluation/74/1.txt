Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes a heatmap that represents a color-coded matrix, but it seems that all required elements are present and correctly displayed. The alignment issue with tick labels is noted, however, as specified, the code does not address this; therefore, the score reflects the absence of a fix for the alignment. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image generally matches the geometry and layout of the Reference Image, with similar color coding and overall structure. However, the tick label positioning issue is significant enough to influence visual correspondence; the values themselves appear correct, but their positioning detracts from the plot’s integrity. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: Titles and labels are correctly presented, and the numeric values within the matrix appear in the appropriate cells and are readable. No additional misalignments or errors are noted regarding text and annotations beyond the tick label issues. Subscore: 12/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color scheme, the use of grid backgrounds, and the overall aesthetic align well with the Reference Image. However, the minor misalignment of tick labels does affect the visual appeal slightly. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The values represented in the heatmap seem to accurately reflect the expected data based on the description provided and the visible content. There are no apparent discrepancies in data representation. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to execute successfully without syntax or runtime errors, and it fulfills the core requirements necessary to generate a heatmap. However, it does not rectify the specific alignment issues that were pointed out in the task description. Subscore: 5/10  

Score: 69/100
