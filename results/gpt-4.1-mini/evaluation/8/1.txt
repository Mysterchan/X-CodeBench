Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image features both major and minor ticks; however, the minor ticks appear in the wrong positions and do not reflect the specified locations in the Reference Image. There is a critical issue since the minor ticks should not override the major ticks. This results in a significant mismatch, limiting the score. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The positioning of major and minor ticks does not align with the Reference Image, particularly in the incorrect placement of minor ticks. Therefore, the visual fidelity suffers significantly, even though the overall plot structure remains intact. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: There are no titles, axis labels, or legends present. However, since the task does not specify them, we won't penalize for this lack, focusing primarily on the ticks. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The style is generally straightforward but not reflective of the specified tick styles in the Reference Image. The colors are represented; however, the incorrect tick placements result in a distinct deviation. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: There is no data presented that requires faithful representation in terms of trends or relationships. However, the tick position and type matter greatly in this context, and the candidate fails to honor the specifications regarding tick placement. Subscore: 5/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code appears to run without errors, but it fails to adequately isolate the configuration changes for minor and major ticks. The attempted fix is present, yet it does not correct the fundamental issue. Subscore: 5/10 

Score: 50/100
