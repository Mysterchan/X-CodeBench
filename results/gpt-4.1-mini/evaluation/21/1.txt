Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly presents the two grouped bar charts for "Yesterday" and "Today," accurately showing the respective data categories ("G1", "G2", "G3"). It meets the basic requirements outlined in the specification. However, the subplots should have been titled "Yesterday" and "Today" accordingly at the top instead of subtitles, which is a slight deviation. Thus, I award this a subscore of 20. (20/25)

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image exhibits a good match to the Reference Image regarding the relative positions and scaling of the bar charts; however, the widths of the bars seem slightly more uniform and less varied compared to the Reference Image. The placement of subplots could be slightly closer to each other. Therefore, I assign a score of 15. (15/20)

Text & Annotations: The titles provided in the Candidate Image accurately correspond to the respective days. However, the reference image lacks a legend, and it is not required per the Natural-Language Specification, so this inclusion in the Candidate Image detracts from the score slightly. The axis labels are correctly labeled according to the categories, but omitting labels for each chart creates confusion. Thus, I assign a score of 10. (10/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The colors are consistent, with “Test1” in blue and “Test2” in orange, matching those in the Reference Image. However, the style of the bars (their height visualization and edge finishing) seems slightly off. The spacing around the charts looks different than the Reference Image, making the overall aesthetics less pleasing. Therefore, I assign a score of 10. (10/15)

Data Faithfulness: The data represented in the Candidate Image corresponds well with the Natural-Language Specification, showing the correct trends and numeric relationships for both "Yesterday" and "Today". The plots accurately reflect the relationships among the grouped categories, meriting a full score here. (15/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code effectively fixes the problem of separate plots by consolidating them into one visualization featuring two subplots. The code appears to execute successfully without runtime errors, and it avoids unnecessary regressions, showing good quality. However, if the code contained extra debugging statements, it would detract from clarity. Hence, I assign a score of 9. (9/10)

Score: 79
