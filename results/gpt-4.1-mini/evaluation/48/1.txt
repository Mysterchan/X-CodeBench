Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly displays a heatmap without a color bar, as specified in the Natural-Language Description. All required plot elements are present. Subscore: 25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image matches the Reference Image closely in terms of geometry, relative positions, and scaling. The axes ranges and subplot arrangement are also consistent. Subscore: 20

Text & Annotations: There are no titles, subtitles, or axis labels present in either the Candidate Image or the Reference Image. However, since the Spec does not explicitly require them, this does not affect the score negatively. Subscore: 15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and overall aesthetics of the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image. There are no major stylistic mismatches. Subscore: 15

Data Faithfulness: The visualization appears to use randomly generated data, which aligns with the intent of the Spec. The trends and color distributions are consistent with what would be expected from such data. Subscore: 15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code successfully removes the color bar and executes without errors. There are no unnecessary regressions or hard-coded artifacts. Subscore: 10

Score: 100
