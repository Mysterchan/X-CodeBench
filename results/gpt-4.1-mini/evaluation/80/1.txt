Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully visualizes the confidence interval as per the specification provided in the Natural-Language Description. The mean line is absent, which aligns with the expectations. However, it is crucial to verify if the confidence intervals are represented correctly. Subscore: 25/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry, scaling, and positions in the Candidate Image match the Reference Image closely. The shaded confidence interval area aligns well with the expected output, although the visual fidelity could be further validated based on the height of the shaded area at the edges. Subscore: 18/20

Text & Annotations: The axis labels are appropriate, with 'day' on the x-axis and 'total_bill' on the y-axis. No titles or subtitles are present, which seems acceptable given the task, but including them could enhance clarity. Subscore: 12/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color of the shaded area is consistent with the Reference Image, and the transparency appears appropriate. However, additional aesthetic details, such as line styles or more defined borders for the shaded area, could enhance clarity. Subscore: 12/15

Data Faithfulness: Since we don't have access to the raw data, the qualitative match of the confidence intervals cannot be explicitly verified. However, based on the visualization, it seems reasonable given the context. Subscore: 13/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully and effectively addresses the requirement of displaying only the confidence interval by removing the mean line. The code appears clean and appropriately structured without unnecessary artifacts. Subscore: 10/10

Score: 100/100
