Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully reproduces the required plot types and data encodings as indicated in the Spec. However, it is missing one of the series present in the Reference Image (specifically 242931), which causes the plot to differ from the expected output. Subscore: 15/25.

Visual Fidelity: The overall layout of the Candidate Image is similar to the Reference Image, including axes positioning and curves. However, the y-axis label is still pushed out of frame, indicating that the fix wasn't completely successful, resulting in some discrepancies. Subscore: 12/20.

Text & Annotations: The title, axis labels, and legend in the Candidate Image are correctly placed and correctly labeled. However, the formatting of the legends doesn't align with the Reference Image; they're not fully visible or distinct due to the missing data series affecting the visual integrity. Subscore: 10/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and line styles used in the Candidate Image match well with the Reference Image. However, the arrangement and visibility of the legend could be improved. Additionally, the overall aesthetic feels slightly compressed due to the y-axis label issue. Subscore: 11/15.

Data Faithfulness: The remaining data series appear accurate and reflect the trends displayed in the Reference Image, apart from the missing series. The Candidate Image's trends qualitatively match the provided description, but the missing line creates a mismatch. Subscore: 10/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code seems to execute without error, addressing the issue described. It employs some appropriate methods for visual correction, but fails to fully resolve the issue with the y-axis label, leading to visual issues. Subscore: 6/10.

Score: 54/100
