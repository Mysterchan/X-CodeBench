Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image displays all required plot elements and includes the 'init' label correctly on the y-axis. However, since there are still only seven unique entries for the data being visualized when eight states are indicated, it raises an issue regarding the accuracy of the y-axis representation. Subscore: 15/25.

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry, relative positions, scaling, and overall plot layout. The y-axis labels have the same alignment and placement as in the Reference Image. There is no visible discrepancy between the two images. Subscore: 20/20.

Text & Annotations: The Candidate Image correctly includes the y-axis label for 'init' in the expected format and position. However, for a complete evaluation, it should be noted that the text needs to accurately reflect the intended count of unique data states. The presence of eight labels while relying on data corresponding to seven unique entries should be considered a minor concern, but it does not heavily detract from the labeling of 'init'. Subscore: 12/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The Candidate Image maintains the exact colors and styles as seen in the Reference Image, aligning with the specifications regarding aesthetics. The color scheme and font choices are consistent, and there is no observable clutter or unnecessary elements. Subscore: 15/15.

Data Faithfulness: The visualization accurately represents the available data states; however, it contradicts the description, as there are only seven unique entries suggested to be presented instead of all eight states mentioned. This brings into question the fidelity of the displayed data against the Natural-Language description. Subscore: 10/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code fixes the original issues highlighted (the missing label issue has been addressed; code executes without errors). It seems that there are no unnecessary regressions or hard-coded artifacts. However, addressing the data mismatch should be noted as it indicates room for improvement, even if the code runs correctly. Subscore: 8/10.

Score: 80/100
