Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully implements the required elements, including the joint plot with a kernel density estimate (KDE) and the vertical dashed line at x=0. All elements specified in the Spec are present. The function appears to execute without errors. Full credit awarded. 25/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry and overall structure. The contours and the area under the curve align closely with the Reference Image, and the axes limits are correctly set to the specified ranges. The only minor discrepancy is that the labels on the y-axis are not explicitly defined, which may affect visual fidelity slightly. 18/20

Text & Annotations: The dashed line is properly located at x=0, and it is styled correctly. However, both axes are labeled as "None," which does not match the Reference Image. Ideally, more informative labels would enhance the clarity of the visualization. Therefore, partial credit is awarded. 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The visualization retains the important style elements from the Reference Image, such as color and line style of the contours and the red dashed line. The aspect ratio is also consistent with the Reference Image. There is a slight inconsistency with the axis labeling; thus, minor penalties apply. 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The joint plot correctly visualizes the KDE of the underlying data as intended, showing appropriate trends and patterns typical to joint distributions. There are no evident data misrepresentations visible in the output. 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code resolves the issues present in the Buggy Code, successfully creating a single cohesive plot instead of separate plots. The code runs successfully without errors. Additionally, any potential redundancy or unnecessary complexity appears to have been avoided. 10/10

Score: 90/100
