Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully includes the heatmap and the asterisks above the specified columns 55 and 66 to indicate statistical significance, fulfilling the primary requirement of the Spec. However, the presence of the extraneous 'A' label in the top left corner is not mentioned in the specification. This diverges from the expected output, impacting the overall correctness. Subscore: 20/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of geometry, relative positions, scaling, axes ranges, and the overall layout of the heatmap. The additional x-axis for statistical significance is accurately placed. However, the stray 'A' label in the top left is inconsistent and affects the visual fidelity. Subscore: 15/20

Text & Annotations: The Candidate Image includes the required asterisks for indicators of statistical significance, but the extraneous 'A' label is incorrect. Conversely, there are no titles, subtitles, or axis labels specified in the provided task description, so any lack thereof does not incur a penalty but potentially affects the interpretation. Subscore: 12/15

Style & Aesthetics: The use of colors, the visual style of the heatmap, and the asterisks are consistent with the Reference Image, maintaining a similar color palette. However, the unexpected 'A' label detracts from the aesthetic coherence. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The Candidate Image accurately represents the data structure assumed in the task, and the placement of the asterisks aligns with the purported statistical significance columns. No data inconsistencies detected relative to specified expectations, hence a high score here. Subscore: 15/15 

Code Quality & Repair Validity: Assuming the code executes without issue in a standard environment and only minor corrections were needed to comply with the Spec, it appears to have succeeded in repairing the buggy code, although it inadvertently caused an extraneous label to appear. No significant regressions seen. Subscore: 8/10

Score: 80/100
