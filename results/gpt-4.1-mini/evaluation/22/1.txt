Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes the arrow with a defined tip, correctly representing the intended visualization from (0, 1) to (1, 2). The essential elements are present and correctly implemented, leading to a full score. 25/25

Visual Fidelity: The arrow is positioned and scaled correctly, matching the Reference Image closely. However, the y-range does not extend to 2.2 as in the Reference Image, which results in a minor visual inconsistency. 18/20

Text & Annotations: There are no titles, subtitles, axis labels, or legends in either the Reference or Candidate image; hence, the score remains neutral here. 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The color and shape of the arrow tip in the Candidate Image closely resembles that of the Reference Image; however, the absence of a full y-axis range in the visual does affect the overall aesthetics slightly. 12/15

Data Faithfulness: The arrow accurately reflects the intended data points and direction based on the description. There are no issues related to data selection or representation. 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code successfully addresses the bug of the arrow tip being invisible. The code appears clean and executes without errors. 9/10

Score: 94
