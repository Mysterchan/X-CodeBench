Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes all required plot elements as specified in the Natural-Language Description. The 3D line is correctly plotted within the specified axis ranges of 0 to 60, and the axes are visible. Thus, it meets the functional requirements fully. Subscore: 25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and scaling of the Candidate Image closely match the Reference Image. Both images display the same plotting of the line in a 3D space. The axis limits are also accurately represented, aligning perfectly with the Reference Image. Subscore: 20

Text & Annotations: The Candidate Image does not include titles, subtitles, or axis labels, which are commonly expected elements in a 3D plot. However, since the omission of text is not explicitly stated in the Spec, it does not severely impact the plot's clarity. Subscore: 10

Style & Aesthetics: The blue line color and style are consistent between the Candidate Image and the Reference Image. There are no visible issues with the aesthetics or order of the plotted line. Subscore: 15

Data Faithfulness: The plotted line correctly represents a linear trend with the appropriate axis ranges and data points specified (from 0 to 60), maintaining the integrity of the data as described in the Spec. Subscore: 15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to fix the initial rendering issue successfully, resulting in a clear and executable plot. The code is clean and uses appropriate API calls to display the 3D plot and axes. Subscore: 10

Score: 95
