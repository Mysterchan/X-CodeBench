Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image inaccurately represents the diagonal line, which fails to extend from the bottom left corner to the top right corner as intended. The line should cover the entire diagonal of the heatmap. Subscore: 10/25
Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image shares similar axes ranges and the overall layout with the Reference Image, but the line's improper length significantly detracts from its fidelity. Subscore: 10/20
Text & Annotations: Titles, axis labels, and legends are not mentioned in the task, but what is present seems adequate without errors. No titles or legends are observed in either image. Subscore: 10/15
Style & Aesthetics: The colors and line style in the Candidate Image align with the Reference Image, but the line's incorrect length creates a major stylistic mismatch. Subscore: 8/15
Data Faithfulness: The candidate visualization maintains consistency in the data structure but is inaccurate in displaying the necessary diagonal trend. Subscore: 10/15
Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code did not effectively fix the main bug regarding the line's extension, leading to non-executable logic in achieving the goal. This hinders code quality as necessary repairs were not validated. Subscore: 5/10
Score: 53/100
