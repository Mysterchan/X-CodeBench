Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully identifies the required plot elements, showing circular markers with error bars as specified in the Natural-Language Description. However, the connected lines are still present, indicating that the repair did not fully address the issue. This impacts the functional correctness significantly. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry, relative positions, and scaling of the Candidate Image closely match the Reference Image, aside from the unwanted lines. Thus, visual fidelity is mostly intact, but the presence of the lines is a critical difference affecting the overall fidelity. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The titles, axis labels, and other annotations appear to be correctly displayed and match the Reference Image. There are no issues here. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and markers of the points match the Reference Image, but the style is not consistent due to the presence of connecting lines, which were not requested. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The data visualization accurately represents the data with error bars and circular markers, maintaining fidelity to the underlying data as per the description. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code does not execute successfully to meet the expectations as it still retains the lines between the points. This affects the code quality and indicates that the repairs made were not valid regarding the requirements. Subscore: 2/10

Score: 52/100
