Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image has attempted to display a 3D surface plot, but the Z-axis remains tilted instead of upright, which is a critical requirement from the Spec. Therefore, the functional correctness is significantly compromised. Subscore: 10/25.

Visual Fidelity: The geometry of the plot does not closely match the Reference Image due to the tilted Z-axis. This impacts the overall layout and visual structure of the plot. The rendered image is not perfectly matching scales or positions as required. Subscore: 10/20.

Text & Annotations: The title is correct, but the Z-axis label ("Y Label") is obstructed and does not match the labeling requirement from the Spec. The labeling of axes is inconsistent with the Reference Image. Subscore: 5/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The color gradient and styling in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image. However, the overall appearance is affected by the tilt of the Z-axis. This constitutes a major stylistic mismatch. Subscore: 10/15.

Data Faithfulness: While the data visuals appear to follow the general trend shown in the Reference Image, the misrepresentation due to the tilted Z-axis might lead to misinterpretation of the data presented. Subscore: 10/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code does not appear to have any runtime errors and executes, but it fails to correct the critical issue of Z-axis orientation fully. Thus, the repair is only partially valid. Subscore: 5/10.

Score: 50/100
