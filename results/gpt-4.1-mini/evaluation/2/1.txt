Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly implements a polar plot to represent the relationship between theta and r, aligning with the Specification and the Reference Image. Full credit is earned. (25/25)

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of the polar coordinate system layout, with appropriate angles and radial values. There is a perfect alignment of geometrical elements. (20/20)

Text & Annotations: The title "stuff" is correctly placed in the Candidate Image, matching the Reference Image. Axis ranges and labels are appropriately addressed. This meets the requirements specified in the Spec. (15/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The line color, style, and overall aesthetic elements are consistent with the Reference Image. There are no significant mismatches in design or presentation style, thus fulfilling aesthetic criteria. (15/15)

Data Faithfulness: The visualization accurately represents the given arrays for theta and r, highlighting the relationship and trends effectively. There are no discrepancies in the data representation. (15/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code successfully fixes the previous bug by transforming the Cartesian plot into a polar plot. Furthermore, it executes without errors and adheres to best practices. No unnecessary code is present. (10/10)
