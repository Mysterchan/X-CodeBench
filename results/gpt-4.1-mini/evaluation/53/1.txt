Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes the required line plot and highlights the maximum and minimum points with horizontal dotted lines. However, the placement of the minimum value label is not effective, as it does not clearly convey its relationship to the data on the y-axis. The maximum value label overlaps with the y-axis tick labels. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image does not match the Reference Image in terms of the x-axis date formatting. The dates are cluttered and not properly formatted, which affects the overall clarity of the visualization. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The text labels for the maximum and minimum values are present but are not positioned correctly. The maximum value overlaps with the y-axis tick labels, and the minimum value is not effectively placed within the plot area. Subscore: 5/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles used in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image. However, the cluttered date formatting detracts from the overall aesthetic. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The data points and their respective values are correctly represented, but the positioning of the labels does not accurately reflect their relationship to the data. Subscore: 10/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to execute successfully, but it does not fully address the issues outlined in the Natural-Language Description, particularly regarding label placement. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 55/100
