Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly includes a sine wave with a filled area corresponding to the specified conditions \( X \geq 3.00 \) and \( Y \leq 0 \). The annotation that was required is present. Full points awarded for all required elements. (25/25)

Visual Fidelity: The overall structure of the Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image. The filled area and the sine wave are appropriately positioned, although there is a slight discrepancy in the shape of the filled region, with the Candidate Image's fill extending slightly more than in the Reference Image. This minor mismatch affects the visual fidelity, but does not critically impact content accuracy. (15/20)

Text & Annotations: The annotation "Filled polygon" is present, correctly positioned, and uses the correct color, which matches the Reference Image. However, the font size or style may differ slightly from the Reference Image, which may influence clarity but is not explicitly stated in the specification. (12/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and style used in the Candidate Image for the sine wave and the fill area closely match that of the Reference Image. However, there is a slight difference in the fill pattern as the edges are not as smooth, which detracts from the aesthetic appeal slightly. (12/15)

Data Faithfulness: The sine wave and the filled area were visually and conceptually correct as per the Natural-Language Description. No data irregularities were identified, and it accurately reflects the required data conditions. (15/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The candidate's code appears to execute without any syntax or runtime errors. It effectively incorporates the required changes and yields the intended plot without regressions. (10/10)
