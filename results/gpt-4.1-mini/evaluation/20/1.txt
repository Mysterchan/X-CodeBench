Comments:
Functional Correctness: The candidate image accurately includes all required plot elements (title, xlabel, ylabel) as specified. However, the text still displays inaccurately (garbled characters), indicating that the fundamental goal was not achieved. Subscore: 10/25.
Visual Fidelity: The geometrical arrangement, position, and scaling of elements in the Candidate Image closely match the Reference Image. However, the garbled characters affect the visual representation. Subscore: 15/20.
Text & Annotations: The candidate has correctly labeled the title, xlabel, and ylabel, but the text is garbled rather than secure. Since the primary focus is on text rendering, this impacts the score significantly. Subscore: 5/15.
Style & Aesthetics: The overall style appears consistent with the Reference Image regarding position and layout, although the text issue detracts from the aesthetic quality. Subscore: 10/15.
Data Faithfulness: The data selection and presentation are irrelevant in this context since there are no visible data points or trends displayed. Thus, this criterion does not apply here. Subscore: 0/15.
Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code demonstrates some attempt to render non-ASCII characters, but it fails to rectify the main issue of character rendering. Without clear evidence of effective bug repair or successful execution, this limits the score. Subscore: 5/10.
Score: 45/100
