Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image does not correctly implement the required stacking order for the histogram. The segments are not arranged as specified in the Natural-Language Description, resulting in a significant mismatch. Subscore: 10/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positions of the bars are correct, but the stacking order is incorrect, which affects the overall visual fidelity. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The titles, axis labels, and legend are present and correctly labeled. However, the legend does not match the stacking order in the Candidate Image. Subscore: 10/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors used in the Candidate Image are consistent with the specifications, but the stacking order is a major stylistic issue. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The data appears to be represented correctly in terms of counts, but the incorrect stacking order undermines the data's faithfulness to the specification. Subscore: 10/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code executes successfully, but it fails to address the primary issue of stacking order. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 55/100
