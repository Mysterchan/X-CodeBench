Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes bars for each age from 9 to 17 and differentiates between Strawberry and Banana fruit types correctly. However, the X-axis ticks are misaligned, as explicitly stated in the Natural-Language Specification. The ticks should correspond to the centers of the bars, which are misaligned in the Candidate Image. Subscore: 15/25.

Visual Fidelity: The geometry, scaling, and overall arrangement of bars in the Candidate Image are similar to the Reference Image, but the misalignment of ticks significantly affects visual fidelity. Subscore: 12/20.

Text & Annotations: Titles and legends for the color coding of fruits are present and accurate in the Candidate Image. However, there is no title for the plot itself. Subscore: 10/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and overall aesthetics are consistent with the Reference Image. There are no major discrepancies in line styles or fills. Subscore: 15/15.

Data Faithfulness: The histograms represent the data categories correctly, and the counts appear to match the expected trends in the Reference Image. Subscore: 15/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully without syntax or runtime errors, suggesting a valid repair to the Buggy Code. Nevertheless, the code doesn't fix the tick position issue adequately. Subscore: 7/10.

Score: 59/100
