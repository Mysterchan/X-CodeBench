Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image successfully includes all required plot elements as specified in the Natural-Language Description, including the correct labels for both axes. The adjustments required for spacing have been properly implemented. Full credit awarded. (25/25)

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of the plot geometry and overall layout. However, the y-axis label is still positioned slightly too close to the axis compared to the Reference Image, which impacts visual fidelity. (15/20)

Text & Annotations: The title, axis labels, and annotations appear correct and complete. There are no discrepancies in text compared to what is expected. (15/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles used in the Candidate Image align well with those in the Reference Image. No major style mismatches were identified. (15/15)

Data Faithfulness: As the plot is not data-dependent, and both Candidate and Reference Images present the same abstract mathematical depiction, there are no issues here. (15/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code fixes the spacing issues as outlined in the spec. There are no syntax or runtime errors, and the implementation is clean and maintains the integrity of the original code structure. (10/10)

Score: 85/100
