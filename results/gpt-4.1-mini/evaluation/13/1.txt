Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes all the required plot elements and accurately represents the plot type as specified in the Natural-Language Description. The annotations at the specified points are also included correctly. However, there is a slight misalignment issue noted in the description but is visually acceptable. Subscore: 22/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image with respect to geometry and relative positions. The lines and markers are positioned correctly, and the scaling appears consistent. However, if the specific alignment of the annotation is considered, then there may be a detected slight positional misalignment. Subscore: 18/20

Text & Annotations: The plot includes appropriate annotations, and the legend title aligns correctly. All elements are clearly labeled, and there are no missing titles or labels based on the information given. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors, line styles, and markers used in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image. The annotation line color seems correct, and the overall aesthetic feels coherent with the intended design. Subscore: 15/15

Data Faithfulness: The data used for plotting appears accurate according to the points given and matches the trend visible in the Reference Image. The annotations reflect the data points specified. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code does not appear to have any syntax or runtime issues, and it properly addresses the alignment issue mentioned in the Buggy Code. It follows a clean coding standard and effectively utilizes the API for plotting. Subscore: 10/10

Score: 100
