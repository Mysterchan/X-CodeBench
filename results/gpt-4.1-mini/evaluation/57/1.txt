Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes both categories ('Y' in blue and 'N' in gray) as specified, but it does not visually represent the 'Y' points on top of the 'N' points. The overlap is present, which is a critical issue. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and relative positions of the points are correct, but the layering is incorrect, which affects the visual fidelity. Subscore: 10/20

Text & Annotations: The titles, axis labels, and legend are correct and complete. Subscore: 15/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and markers are consistent with the Reference Image, but the layering issue detracts from the overall aesthetic. Subscore: 10/15

Data Faithfulness: The data representation is accurate in terms of categories and colors, but the visual representation does not reflect the intended layering. Subscore: 10/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The code appears to execute successfully, but it does not address the layering issue effectively. Subscore: 5/10

Score: 60/100
