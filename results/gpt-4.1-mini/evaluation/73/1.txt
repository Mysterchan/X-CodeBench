Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image has correctly updated the y-axis to display only the years, which aligns with the intended specification. However, it still contains the month indicators (or at least is formatted in such a way that they appear as distinct on the y-axis). This impacts the score significantly. Subscore: 15/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image visually respects the structure of the heatmap, but the presence of month indicators (or a misleading appearance that includes them) detracts from it matching the Reference Image closely. Subscore: 12/20 

Text & Annotations: The titles, axis labels, and color bar labels appear to be correct, but the clarity of the y-tick labels could be improved upon further inspection, as they may imply a monthly breakdown by their formatting. Subscore: 10/15 

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and overall appearance of the heatmap in the Candidate Image closely resemble the Reference Image, which is positive. Legibility and presentation are acceptable as well. Subscore: 13/15 

Data Faithfulness: The heatmap appears to reflect the data accurately, however, the presence of "None" within the y-axis labels introduces confusion about the data representation. Subscore: 10/15 

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes without errors and does effectively make changes to the y-axis labels, but it should have clearly omitted the month indicators entirely to align with the specification fully. Subscore: 5/10 

Score: 65/100
