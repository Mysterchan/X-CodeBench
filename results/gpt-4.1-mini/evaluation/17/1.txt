Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly implements a 3D scatter plot with points defined by x, y, and z coordinates. The x and y axes are labeled correctly as "X Label" and "Y Label," respectively. However, the z-axis is labeled "Z Label" instead of "Z data," which does not fully adhere to the specification. Overall, it captures the required plot characteristics. Subscore: 20/25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image closely matches the Reference Image in terms of the geometry and layout of the 3D scatter plot. The relative positions of the points and the overall scaling are consistent with what is presented in the Reference Image. Subscore: 18/20

Text & Annotations: The titles and labels on the axes are present, but the z-axis label is inaccurate as it should be "Z data" instead of "Z Label." The other labels are correct and complete. Subscore: 11/15

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and marker styles used in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image. There are no major discrepancies in style or aesthetics. Subscore: 15/15

Data Faithfulness: The visualization appears to represent the correct data as specified in the Natural-Language Description. The trends and positions of the scatter plot are consistent with the expected outcomes. Subscore: 15/15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code executes successfully and appears to rectify the issues present in the Buggy Code, fulfilling the purpose of the task. Subscore: 10/10

Score: 89/100
