Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly includes the required elements as specified in the specification. Both subplots contain the plots generated by `my_plot_1` and `my_plot_2`, which are represented accurately. There are no missing components, and the figures are displayed as intended. Subscore: 25

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image matches the Reference Image closely in terms of geometry and positions of the plots. The scaling appears correct, and the axes ranges are consistent with the Reference Image. The subplot arrangement is also accurate. Subscore: 20

Text & Annotations: No text labels or annotations were required according to the specification. Thus, there are no additional titles or legends, which aligns with the requirements. The absence of text is acceptable based on the provided details. Subscore: 15

Style & Aesthetics: The Candidate Image replicates the color, line style, and general aesthetics observed in the Reference Image. All graphical elements align well with what is expected. Subscore: 15

Data Faithfulness: The Candidate Image appears faithful to the data intended for both plots. The trends and visual representation of the data show a clear linearly increasing pattern for both subplots, which corresponds accurately to the expected output as per the Reference Image. Subscore: 15

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code effectively resolves the previous issues present in the Buggy Code, executing successfully without syntax or runtime errors. The code appears clean, and there are no unnecessary regressions or hard-coded artifacts. Subscore: 10

Score: 100
