Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly displays the horizontal barplot with the desired orientation. The bars are positioned appropriately, extending towards the left from the maximum value on the x-axis. All elements are present as specified. (25/25)

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image matches the Reference Image closely in terms of the geometry, relative positions, and scaling of the bars. However, the lack of clarity on whether the x-axis maximum corresponds to the same limits in both images is slightly ambiguous. (18/20)

Text & Annotations: The titles and labels in the Candidate Image correctly represent the data as described in the Spec. All labels (x1, x2, x3) are correctly placed on the right side of the graph. (15/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The Candidate Image adheres to the expected color and style used in the Reference Image. The color scheme is consistent, and the bars are styled well. (15/15)

Data Faithfulness: The Candidate Image maintains the integrity of the data and accurately reflects the relationship between the values as shown in the Reference Image. (15/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to successfully address the requirements and fixes any issues in the Buggy Code. It runs without errors and avoids unnecessary complexity. (10/10)
