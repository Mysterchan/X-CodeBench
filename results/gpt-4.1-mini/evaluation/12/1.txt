Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image includes the required 3D vector plotted at the coordinates [1, 1, -1], but it lacks proper visibility relative to the reference. The point is too similar in color and size to the mesh grid and blends in rather than standing out. As a result, it receives a lower score here. Subscore: 15/25.

Visual Fidelity: The Candidate Image does capture the 3D structure and grid lines but does not represent the same visual clarity as the Reference Image, mainly due to the point’s low visibility. The grid and point positioning seem accurate, yet the intensity and clarity do not match. Subscore: 10/20.

Text & Annotations: The axes are labeled correctly as "X label", "Y label", and "Z label". However, the labeling can be improved to ensure clarity. Still, all required annotations are present. Subscore: 10/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The point in the Candidate Image appears too muted compared to the Reference Image. The style adheres to a clean aesthetic of 3D plotting, but the lack of color differentiation for the vector leads to diminished effectiveness. Subscore: 10/15.

Data Faithfulness: The rendering maintains proper coordinates for the vector and grid structure. However, since the point's visibility is low, it somewhat misrepresents the intended data communication, affecting overall interpretation fidelity. Subscore: 10/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The candidate code appears functional; it executes as intended without errors, but modifications might be necessary to improve visibility previously mentioned. The code meets the specifications without additional regressions. Subscore: 8/10.

Score: 63/100
