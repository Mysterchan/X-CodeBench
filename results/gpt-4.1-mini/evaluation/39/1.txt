Comments:
Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly illustrates the data trend but fails to adhere to the specification of displaying only the minimum and maximum labels on the y-axis. Both the minimum and maximum y-values are shown, but the presence of the y-axis line detracts from the requested plot style. Subscore: 15/25.

Visual Fidelity: The overall geometry of the Candidate Image aligns with the Reference Image; however, the extra y-axis line detracts from the intended clean aesthetic of the plot. The visual layout is otherwise correct. Subscore: 15/20.

Text & Annotations: The y-axis retains appropriate labels for the minimum and maximum values; however, the excessive y-axis line and presence of other default ticks are inconsistent with the natural-language description. Subscore: 10/15.

Style & Aesthetics: The Candidate Image is mostly aesthetically pleasing and uses a consistent color scheme, but the additional y-axis line is a significant stylistic mismatch according to the requirements. Subscore: 10/15.

Data Faithfulness: The trends and relationships within the data are accurately represented in the Candidate Image. It mirrors the data portrayed in the Reference Image effectively. Subscore: 15/15.

Code Quality & Repair Validity: Although there are no apparent syntax or runtime errors, the code does not fully implement the specified changes to achieve the desired plot minimalism. Thus, while it executes successfully, it does not adequately resolve the identified issues. Subscore: 5/10.

Score: 55/100
