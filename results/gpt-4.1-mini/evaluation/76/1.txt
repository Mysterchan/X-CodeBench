Functional Correctness: The Candidate Image correctly includes a boxplot of player scores and the corresponding points represented by a swarmplot. However, it is missing the connecting lines that represent the relationship between scores of the same player across different courts. This is a critical element specified in the description. The score for this criterion is capped at 5 due to the missing lines. (Subscore: 5/25)

Visual Fidelity: The geometry and positions of the boxplots and points in the Candidate Image are correct and match the Reference Image well, except for the absence of the connecting lines. The overall scaling and axes ranges also match closely, so the score is relatively high here. (Subscore: 15/20)

Text & Annotations: The titles, labels, and legends present in the Candidate Image are correct and complete. The color labels for "win" and "no win" are present and match the Reference Image. (Subscore: 15/15)

Style & Aesthetics: The colors and styles used in the Candidate Image are consistent with the Reference Image, except for the missing connection lines. Thus, while the overall aesthetics are good, the absence of the lines detracts from the score slightly. (Subscore: 12/15)

Data Faithfulness: The Candidate Image seems to reflect the data accurately without any evident distortions or errors in plotting the boxplots or points. The relationships presented, albeit incomplete due to the lack of connecting lines, maintain the integrity of the data representation. (Subscore: 12/15)

Code Quality & Repair Validity: The Candidate Code appears to rectify some issues from the Buggy Code, but since it fails to add the crucial connecting lines, it ultimately does not fully resolve the core issue. There are no syntax or runtime errors in the code, but it does not fully execute the intended visualization. (Subscore: 5/10)

Score: 54/100
