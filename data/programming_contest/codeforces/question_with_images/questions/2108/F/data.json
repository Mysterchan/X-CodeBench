    "Problem Statement": "Pizano built an array $a$ of $n$ towers, each consisting of $a_i ≥ 0$ blocks.\nPizano can knock down a tower so that the next $a_i$ towers grow by $1$. In other words, he can take the element $a_i$, increase the next $a_i$ elements by one, and then set $a_i$ to $0$. The blocks that fall outside the array of towers disappear. If Pizano knocks down a tower with $0$ blocks, nothing happens.\nPizano wants to knock down all $n$ towers in any order, each exactly once. That is, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, he will knock down the tower at position $i$ exactly once.\nMoreover, the resulting array of tower heights must be non-decreasing. This means that after he knocks down all $n$ towers, for any $i < j$, the tower at position $i$ must not be taller than the tower at position $j$.\nYou are required to output the maximum $\\text{MEX}$ of the resulting array of tower heights.\nThe $\\text{MEX}$ of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5$) — the number of towers.\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers — the initial heights of the towers $a_1, ..., a_n$ ($0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum $\\text{MEX}$ of the final array.",
