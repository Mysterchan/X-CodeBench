    "Problem Statement": "ParagonX9 - HyperioxX⠀\nAlice has a grid of size $n \\times n$. Initially, all cells are colored white. Alice wants to color some cells black satisfying certain properties.\nLet $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_m, y_m)$ be the cells colored black. You are given an array $a$ of size $n$. The following conditions must be satisfied: - For each row $k$ ($1 ≤ k ≤ n$), there exists exactly $a_k$ indices $i$ ($1 ≤ i ≤ m$) such that $x_i = k$. Less formally, there should be $a_k$ black cells in row $k$. - For each $k$ ($1 ≤ k ≤ n$), there exists exactly one index $i$ such that $\\max(x_i, y_i) = k$. - For each $k$ ($1 ≤ k ≤ n$), there exists exactly one index $i$ such that $\\max(x_i, n + 1 - y_i) = k$. \nFor example, when $a = [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]$, a possible set of black cells is $\\{(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (2, 4), (1, 5)\\}$. This corresponds to the following grid: ![image](1.png) 5×5 grid with specified black cells. \nCount the number of possible grids. $2$ grids are said to be different if there is some cell which is colored black in one of the grids, and white in the other. Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.",
