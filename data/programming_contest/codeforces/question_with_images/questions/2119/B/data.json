    "Problem Statement": "PIKASONIC - Lost My Mind (feat.nakotanmaru)\nYou are given two points $(p_x,p_y)$ and $(q_x,q_y)$ on a Euclidean plane.\nYou start at the starting point $(p_x,p_y)$ and will perform $n$ operations. In the $i$-th operation, you must choose any point such that the Euclidean distance$^{\\text{∗}}$ between your current position and the point is exactly $a_i$, and then move to that point.\nDetermine whether it is possible to reach the terminal point $(q_x,q_y)$ after performing all operations.\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The Euclidean distance between $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1≤ n ≤ 10^3$) — the length of the sequence $a$.\nThe second line of each test case contains four integers $p_x,p_y,q_x,q_y$ ($1≤ p_x,p_y,q_x,q_y≤ 10^7$) — the coordinates of the starting point and terminal point.\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ ($1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4$) — the distance to move in each operation.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output \"Yes\" if it is possible to reach the terminal point $(q_x,q_y)$ after all operations; otherwise, output \"No\".\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
