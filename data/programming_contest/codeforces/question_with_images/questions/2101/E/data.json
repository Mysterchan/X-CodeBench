    "Problem Statement": "You are given a binary string $s$ of length $n$ and a tree $T$ with $n$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of 1s in $s$. We will construct a complete undirected weighted graph with $k$ vertices as follows: - For each $1≤ i≤ n$ with $s_i = \\mathtt{1}$, create a vertex labeled $i$. - For any two vertices labeled $u$ and $v$ that are created in the above step, define the edge weight between them $w(u, v)$ as the distance$^{\\text{∗}}$ between vertex $u$ and vertex $v$ in the tree $T$. \nA simple path$^{\\text{†}}$ that visits vertices labeled $v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$ in this order is nice if for all $1≤ i≤ m - 2$, the condition $2\\cdot w(v_i, v_{i + 1})≤ w(v_{i + 1}, v_{i + 2})$ holds. In other words, the weight of each edge in the path must be at least twice the weight of the previous edge. Note that $s_{v_i} = \\mathtt{1}$ has to be satisfied for all $1≤ i≤ m$, as otherwise, there would be no vertex with the corresponding label.\nFor each vertex labeled $i$ ($1≤ i≤ n$ and $s_i = \\mathtt{1}$) in the complete undirected weighted graph, determine the maximum number of vertices in any nice simple path starting from the vertex labeled $i$.\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The distance between two vertices $a$ and $b$ in a tree is equal to the number of edges on the unique simple path between vertex $a$ and vertex $b$.\n$^{\\text{†}}$A path is a sequence of vertices $v_1, v_2, ..., v_m$ such that there is an edge between $v_i$ and $v_{i + 1}$ for all $1≤ i≤ m - 1$. A simple path is a path with no repeated vertices, i.e., $v_i\\neq v_j$ for all $1≤ i < j≤ m$.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1≤ n≤ 7\\cdot10^4$) — the length of the binary string $s$ and the number of vertices in the tree $T$.\nThe second line of each test case contains a binary string with $n$ characters $s_1s_2... s_n$ ($s_i\\in \\{\\mathtt{0}, \\mathtt{1}\\}$) — the string representing the vertices to be constructed in the complete undirected weighted graph.\nEach of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1≤ u, v≤ n$) — the endpoints of the edges of the tree $T$.\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $7\\cdot10^4$. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output $n$ integers, the $i$-th integer representing the maximum number of vertices in any nice simple path starting from the vertex labeled $i$. If there is no vertex labeled $i$, i.e., $s_i = \\mathtt{0}$, output $-1$ instead.",

    "Notes": "Note\nIn the first test case, the tree $T$ and the constructed graph are as follows: ![image](1.png) Left side is the tree $T$ with selected nodes colored yellow. The right side is the constructed complete graph. \nThe nice path shown in the diagram is $3\\rightarrow 4\\rightarrow 2$. The path is nice as $w(4, 2) = 2$ is at least twice of $w(3, 4) = 1$. Extending the path using $2\\rightarrow 5$ is not possible as $w(2, 5) = 3$ is less than twice of $w(4, 2) = 2$.\nIn the second test case, the tree $T$ is a simple path of length $17$. An example of a nice path starting from the vertex labeled $2$ is $2\\rightarrow 3\\rightarrow 5\\rightarrow 9\\rightarrow 17$, which has edge weights of $1, 2, 4, 8$ doubling each time.",
