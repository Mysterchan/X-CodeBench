    "Problem Statement": "Steve has a permutation$^{\\text{∗}}$ $p$ and an array $c$, both of length $n$. Steve wishes to sort the permutation $p$. \nSteve has an infinite supply of coloured sand blocks, and using them he discovered a physics-based way to sort an array of numbers called gravity sort. Namely, to perform gravity sort on $p$, Steve will do the following:  - For all $i$ such that $1 ≤ i ≤ n$, place a sand block of color $c_i$ in position $(i, j)$ for all $j$ where $1 ≤ j ≤ p_i$. Here, position $(x, y)$ denotes a cell in the $x$-th row from the top and $y$-th column from the left. - Apply downwards gravity to the array, so that all sand blocks fall as long as they can fall.  ![image](1.png) An example of gravity sort for the third testcase. $p = [4, 2, 3, 1, 5]$, $c = [2, 1, 4, 1, 5]$ \nAlex looks at Steve's sand blocks after performing gravity sort and wonders how many pairs of arrays $(p',c')$ where $p'$ is a permutation would have resulted in the same layout of sand. Note that the original pair of arrays $(p, c)$ will always be counted.\nPlease calculate this for Alex. As this number could be large, output it modulo $998\\,244\\,353$.\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is a $4$ in the array).",

    "Notes": "Note\nThe second test case is shown below. ![image](2.png) Gravity sort of the second testcase. \nIt can be shown that permutations of $p$ will yield the same result, and that $c$ must equal $[1,1,1,1,1]$ (since all sand must be the same color), so the answer is $5! = 120$.\nThe third test case is shown in the statement above. It can be proven that no other arrays $p$ and $c$ will produce the same final result, so the answer is $1$.",
