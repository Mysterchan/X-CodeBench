    "Problem Statement": "This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is the constraint on $k$ and the total sum of $n$ and $q$ across all test cases. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.\nYou are given a strip of length $10^{15}$ and a constant $k$. There are exactly $n$ cells that contain a traffic light; each has a position $p_i$ and an initial delay $d_i$ for which $d_i < k$. The $i$-th traffic light works the following way:  - it shows red at the $l \\cdot k + d_i$-th second, where $l$ is an integer, - it shows green otherwise. \nAt second $0$, you are initially positioned at some cell on the strip, facing the positive direction. At each second, you perform the following actions in order:  - If the current cell contains a red traffic light, you turn around. - Move one cell in the direction you are currently facing. \nYou are given $q$ different starting positions. For each one, determine whether you will eventually leave the strip within $10^{100}$ seconds.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 2\\cdot10^5$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($\\mathbf{1 ≤ n ≤ 2\\cdot10^5}$ and $\\mathbf{1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{15}}$) — the number of traffic lights and the length of the period.\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, ... p_n$ ($1 ≤ p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_n ≤ 10^{15}$) — the positions of the traffic lights.\nThe third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, ... d_n$ ($0 ≤ d_i < k$) — the delays of the traffic lights.\nThe fourth line of each test case contains one integer $q$ ($\\mathbf{1 ≤ q ≤ 2\\cdot10^5}$) — the number of queries.\nThe fifth line of each test case contains $q$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_q$ ($1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{15}$) — the starting positions.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $\\mathbf{2\\cdot10^5}$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output $q$ lines. Each line should contain \"YES\" if you will eventually leave the strip and \"NO\" otherwise. You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
