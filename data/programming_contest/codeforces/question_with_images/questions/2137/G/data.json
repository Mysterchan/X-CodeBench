    "Problem Statement": "There is a directed acyclic graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. Each node is initially colored blue.\nLet's define the fun graph game as follows: - Initially, a token is placed on node $s$. - Cry and River take turns moving the token to a node such that there exists a directed edge from its current position to that node, with Cry going first. - Cry wins if the token ever reaches a node with no outgoing edges, after either player's turn. - River wins if the token reaches a red node after either player's turn. - If the players reach a node that is both red and does not have outgoing edges, River wins. \nSince the graph is acyclic, it can be shown that the game always ends in a finite number of turns. \nNote that Cry and River can win the game immediately if the starting node $s$ doesn't have outgoing edges, or is red respectively.\nYou must handle $q$ queries of the following kind: - 1 u: update the color of node $u$ to red. It is guaranteed that node $u$ was blue before this update. - 2 u: If a fun graph game is played with the token initially at node $u$, and both players play optimally, does Cry win?",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, $q$ ($2 ≤ n ≤ 2\\cdot 10^5$ ,$1 ≤ m,q ≤ 2\\cdot 10^5$).\nThe following $m$ lines each contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 ≤ u,v ≤ n$), meaning that there is an edge from $u$ to $v$. \nThe following $q$ lines each contain two integers $x$ and $u$ ($1 ≤ x ≤ 2, 1 ≤ u ≤ n$) – denoting the type of query and the node that the query is done on.\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is a directed acyclic graph. Additionally, no edge is given more than once.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$, the sum of $m$, and the sum of $q$ each do not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$ over all test cases.\nOutput\nFor each query of the second type, output YES if Cry wins. Otherwise, output NO. Each letter may be outputted in uppercase or lowercase.",

    "Notes": "Note\nBelow shows the graph in the sample.  ![image](1.png) \nInitially, all nodes are blue. Thus, Cry cannot lose, and eventually the token will be moved to a node without outgoing edges.\nAfter nodes $3$ and $4$ are painted red, the nodes $1,3,4$ now start off as a win for River when playing optimally. If the game starts at nodes $3$ and $4$, River wins immediately. If the game starts at node $1$, one way the game can go is as follows: - Cry moves the token to node $2$. - River moves the token to node $3$, which is red, so River wins. .\nIt can be shown that Cry still wins with optimal play for all other nodes.",
