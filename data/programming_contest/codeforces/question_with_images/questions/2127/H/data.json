    "Problem Statement": "Kiarash is picking strawberries to take home...\nA graph is called candy if and only if the degree of every vertex in it is at most $2$.\nYou are given a simple, undirected, and connected graph $G$ of $n≤ 30$ vertices, with a special property: each vertex belongs to at most $5$ simple cycles$^{\\text{∗}}$.\nWhat is the maximum number of edges among all subgraphs$^{\\text{†}}$ of $G$ that are candy?\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A simple cycle is a connected subgraph such that each vertex has a degree of exactly $2$\n$^{\\text{†}}$A subgraph of $G$ is a graph whose vertices and edges are subsets of $G$.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 50$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 ≤ n ≤ 30$, $n-1 ≤ m ≤ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$) — the number of vertices and the number of edges.\nThen $m$ lines follow, the $i$-th line containing two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 ≤ u, v ≤ n$) — the two vertices that the $i$-th edge connects.\nIt is guaranteed that the given graph is simple and connected, and each vertex belongs to at most $5$ simple cycles.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $900$. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of edges among all subgraphs that are candy graphs.",

    "Notes": "Note\nIn the first test case, you can select the edges marked in the image below. On the other hand, you can't select all the edges because the degree of vertex $3$ would exceed $2$. So the maximum number of edges among all subgraphs that are candy is $3$.  ![image](1.png) \nIn the second test case, you can select the edges marked in the image below. It can be proven that any subgraph that is candy has at most $7$ edges.  ![image](2.png) \nIn the third test case, the image below shows one of the subgraphs with the maximum possible number of edges that is candy.  ![image](3.png)",
