    "Problem Statement": "There is a 2D-coordinate plane that ranges from $(0,0)$ to $(x, y)$. You are located at $(0,0)$ and want to head to $(x, y)$. \nHowever, there are $n$ horizontal lasers, with the $i$-th laser continuously spanning $(0, a_i)$ to $(x, a_i)$. Additionally, there are also $m$ vertical lasers, with the $i$-th laser continuously spanning $(b_i, 0)$ to $(b_i, y)$.\nYou may move in any direction to reach $(x, y)$, but your movement must be a continuous curve that lies inside the plane. Every time you cross a vertical or a horizontal laser, it counts as one crossing. Particularly, if you pass through an intersection point between two lasers, it counts as two crossings.\nFor example, if $x = y = 2$, $n = m = 1$, $a = [1]$, $b = [1]$, the movement can be as follows: ![image](1.png) \nWhat is the minimum number of crossings necessary to reach $(x, y)$?",

It is guaranteed that $a_i > a_{i-1}$ for all $i > 1$.\nThe following line contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$ ($0 < b_i < x$)  — the x-coordinates of the vertical lasers. It is guaranteed that $b_i > b_{i-1}$ for all $i > 1$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of crossings necessary to reach $(x, y)$.",
