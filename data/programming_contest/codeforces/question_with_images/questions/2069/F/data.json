    "Problem Statement": "A connected component of an undirected graph is defined as a set of vertices $S$ of this graph such that: - for every pair of vertices $(u, v)$ in $S$, there exists a path between vertices $u$ and $v$; - there is no vertex outside $S$ that has a path to a vertex within $S$. \nFor example, the graph in the picture below has three components: $\\{1, 3, 7, 8\\}$, $\\{2\\}$, $\\{4, 5, 6\\}$. ![image](1.png) \nWe say that graph $A$ includes graph $B$ if every component of graph $B$ is a subset of some component of graph $A$.\nYou are given two graphs, $A$ and $B$, both consisting of $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. Initially, there are no edges in the graphs. You must process queries of two types: - add an edge to one of the graphs; - remove an edge from one of the graphs. \nAfter each query, you have to calculate the minimum number of edges that have to be added to $A$ so that $A$ includes $B$, and print it. Note that you don't actually add these edges, you just calculate their number.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 ≤ n ≤ 4 \\cdot 10^5$; $1 ≤ q ≤ 4 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices and queries, respectively.\nNext, there are $q$ lines, where the $i$-th line describes the $i$-th query. The description of the query begins with the character $c_i$ (either A or B) — the graph to which the query should be applied. Then, two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ follow ($1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n$; $x_i \\ne y_i$). If there is an edge $(x_i, y_i)$ in the corresponding graph, it should be removed; otherwise, it should be added to that graph.\nOutput\nFor each query, print one integer — the minimum number of edges that you have to add to the graph $A$ so that it includes $B$.",
