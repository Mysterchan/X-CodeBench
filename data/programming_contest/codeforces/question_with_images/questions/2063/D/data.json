    "Problem Statement": "Even Little John needs money to buy a house. But he recently lost his job; how will he earn money now? Of course, by playing a game that gives him money as a reward! Oh well, maybe not those kinds of games you are thinking about. \nThere are $n+m$ distinct points $(a_1,0), (a_2,0), ..., (a_{n},0), (b_1,2), (b_2,2), ..., (b_{m},2)$ on the plane. Initially, your score is $0$. To increase your score, you can perform the following operation: - Choose three distinct points which are not collinear; - Increase your score by the area of the triangle formed by these three points; - Then, erase the three points from the plane.  ![image](1.png)![image](2.png)![image](3.png)![image](4.png) An instance of the game, where the operation is performed twice. \nLet $k_{\\max}$ be the maximum number of operations that can be performed. For example, if it is impossible to perform any operation, $k_\\max$ is $0$. Additionally, define $f(k)$ as the maximum possible score achievable by performing the operation exactly $k$ times. Here, $f(k)$ is defined for all integers $k$ such that $0 ≤ k ≤ k_{\\max}$.\nFind the value of $k_{\\max}$, and find the values of $f(x)$ for all integers $x=1,2,...,k_{\\max}$ independently.",

The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 ≤ n,m ≤ 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ pairwise distinct integers $a_1,a_2,...,a_{n}$ — the points on $y=0$ ($-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9$).\nThe third line of each test case contains $m$ pairwise distinct integers $b_1,b_2,...,b_{m}$ — the points on $y=2$ ($-10^9 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9$).\nIt is guaranteed that both the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases do not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, given that the maximum number of operations is $k_{\\max}$, you must output at most two lines: - The first line contains the value of $k_{\\max}$; - The second line contains $k_{\\max}$ integers denoting $f(1),f(2),...,f(k_{\\max})$. You are allowed to omit this line if $k_{\\max}$ is $0$. \nNote that under the constraints of this problem, it can be shown that all values of $f(x)$ are integers no greater than $10^{16}$.",

    "Notes": "Note\nOn the first test case, there are $1+3=4$ points $(0,0),(0,2),(1,2),(-1,2)$.\nIt can be shown that you cannot perform two or more operations. The value of $k_{\\max}$ is $1$, and you are only asked for the value of $f(1)$.\nYou can choose $(0,0)$, $(-1,2)$, and $(1,2)$ as the three vertices of the triangle. After that, your score is increased by the area of the triangle, which is $2$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $2$. Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $2$.\nOn the fifth test case, there are $8+2=10$ points.\nIt can be shown that you cannot perform three or more operations. The value of $k_{\\max}$ is $2$, and you are asked for the values $f(1)$ and $f(2)$.\nTo maximize the score with only one operation, you can choose three points $(198\\,872\\,582,0)$, $(-1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$, and $(1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. Then, the three points are erased from the plane. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing one operation is $2\\,000\\,000\\,000$. Therefore, the value of $f(1)$ is $2\\,000\\,000\\,000$.\nTo maximize the score with exactly two operations, you can choose the following sequence of operations. - Choose three points $(-509\\,489\\,796,0)$, $(553\\,177\\,666,0)$, and $(-1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. The three points are erased. - Choose three points $(-400\\,714\\,529,0)$, $(564\\,040\\,265,0)$, and $(1\\,000\\,000\\,000,2)$. The three points are erased. \nThen, the score after two operations becomes $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$. It can be shown that the maximum value of your score after performing exactly two operations is $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$. Therefore, the value of $f(2)$ is $2\\,027\\,422\\,256$.",
