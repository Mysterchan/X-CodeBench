    "Problem Statement": "Aryan is an ardent lover of squares but a hater of rectangles (Yes, he knows all squares are rectangles). But Harshith likes to mess with Aryan. Harshith gives Aryan three rectangles of sizes $l_1\\times b_1$, $l_2\\times b_2$, and $l_3\\times b_3$ such that $l_3≤ l_2≤ l_1$ and $b_3≤ b_2≤ b_1$. Aryan, in order to defeat Harshith, decides to arrange these three rectangles to form a square such that no two rectangles overlap and the rectangles are aligned along edges. Rotating rectangles is not allowed. Help Aryan determine if he can defeat Harshith.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 100$). The description of the test cases follows. \nEach test case contains a single line with $6$ space-separated integers $l_1, b_1, l_2, b_2, l_3$, and $b_3$ ($1 ≤ l_3≤ l_2≤ l_1≤ 100$, $1≤ b_3≤ b_2≤ b_1 ≤ 100$) — the dimensions of the three rectangles.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if the rectangles can be arranged to form a square; otherwise, \"NO\".\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
