    "Problem Statement": "Aryan loves graph theory more than anything. Well, no, he likes to flex his research paper on line graphs to everyone more. To start a conversation with you, he decides to give you a problem on line graphs. In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of a simple undirected graph $G$ is another simple undirected graph $L(G)$ that represents the adjacency between every two edges in $G$.\nPrecisely speaking, for an undirected graph $G$ without self-loops or multiple edges, its line graph $L(G)$ is a graph such that - Each vertex of $L(G)$ represents an edge of $G$. - Two vertices of $L(G)$ are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint in $G$.  ![image](1.png) \nAlso, $L^0(G)=G$ and $L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G))$ for $k≥ 1$. \nAn Euler trail is a sequence of edges that visits every edge of the graph exactly once. This trail can be either a path (starting and ending at different vertices) or a cycle (starting and ending at the same vertex). Vertices may be revisited during the trail, but each edge must be used exactly once.\nAryan gives you a simple connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges and an integer $k$, and it is guaranteed that $G$ has an Euler trail and it is not a path graph$^{\\text{∗}}$. He asks you to determine if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler trail. \n$^{\\text{∗}}$A path graph is a tree where every vertex is connected to atmost two other vertices.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers $n$, $m$, and $k$ ($5 ≤ n ≤ 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $n-1 ≤ m ≤ \\min(\\frac{n\\cdot(n-1)}{2} ,2 \\cdot 10^5)$, $1 ≤ k ≤ 2 \\cdot 10^5$).\nThe next $m$ lines of each test case contain two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 ≤ u,v ≤ n$, $u \\neq v$), denoting that an edge connects vertices $u$ and $v$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print \"YES\" if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler trail; otherwise, \"NO\".\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",

    "Notes": "Note\nFor the first test case, $L^2(G)$ is isomorphic to $G$ itself. So, since $G$ has an Euler trail, $L^2(G)$ also has an Euler trail.\nFor the second test case, $L(G)$ looks as follows(Vertex $i-j$ of $L(G)$ in figure corresponds to edge between vertices $i$ and $j$ of $G$). It can be proven that this doesn't have an Euler trail. ![image](2.png)",
