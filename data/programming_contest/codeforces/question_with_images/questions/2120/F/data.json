    "Problem Statement": "As we all know, Aryan is a funny guy. He decides to create fun graphs. For a graph $G$, he defines fun graph $G'$ of $G$ as follows: - Every vertex $v'$ of $G'$ maps to a non-empty independent set$^{\\text{∗}}$ or clique$^{\\text{†}}$ in $G$. - The sets of vertices of $G$ that the vertices of $G'$ map to are pairwise disjoint and combined cover all the vertices of $G$, i.e., the sets of vertices of $G$ mapped by vertices of $G'$ form a partition of the vertex set of $G$. - If an edge connects two vertices $v_1'$ and $v_2'$ in $G'$, then there is an edge between every vertex of $G$ in the set mapped to $v_1'$ and every vertex of $G$ in the set mapped to $v_2'$. - If an edge does not connect two vertices $v_1'$ and $v_2'$ in $G'$, then there is not an edge between any vertex of $G$ in the set mapped to $v_1'$ and any vertex of $G$ in the set mapped to $v_2'$. \nAs we all know again, Harshith is a superb guy. He decides to use fun graphs to create his own superb graphs. For a graph $G$, a fun graph $G' '$ is called a superb graph of $G$ if $G' '$ has the minimum number of vertices among all possible fun graphs of $G$.\nAryan gives Harshith $k$ simple undirected graphs$^{\\text{‡}}$ $G_1, G_2,...,G_k$, all on the same vertex set $V$. Harshith then wonders if there exist $k$ other graphs $H_1, H_2,...,H_k$, all on some other vertex set $V'$ such that: - $G_i$ is a superb graph of $H_i$ for all $i\\in \\{1,2,...,k\\}$. - If a vertex $v\\in V$ maps to an independent set of size greater than $1$ in one $G_i, H_i$ ($1≤ i≤ k$) pair, then there exists no pair $G_j, H_j$ ($1≤ j≤ k, j\\neq i$) where $v$ maps to a clique of size greater than $1$. \nHelp Harshith solve his wonder.\n$^{\\text{∗}}$For a graph $G$, a subset $S$ of vertices is called an independent set if no two vertices of $S$ are connected with an edge.\n$^{\\text{†}}$For a graph $G$, a subset $S$ of vertices is called a clique if every vertex of $S$ is connected to every other vertex of $S$ with an edge.\n$^{\\text{‡}}$A graph is a simple undirected graph if its edges are undirected and there are no self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 100$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1≤ n≤ 300, 1≤ k≤ 10$).\nThen, there are $k$ graphs described. The first line of each graph description contains a single integer $m$ ($0≤ m≤ \\frac{n\\cdot(n-1)}{2}$).\nNext $m$ lines each contain two space-separated integers $u$ and $v$ ($1≤ u, v≤ n, u\\neq v$), denoting that an edge connects vertices $u$ and $v$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $m$ over all graphs over all test cases does not exceed $2\\cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $300$.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print \"Yes\" if there exists $k$ graphs satisfying the conditions; otherwise, \"No\".\nYou can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings \"yEs\", \"yes\", \"Yes\", and \"YES\" will be recognized as positive responses.",
