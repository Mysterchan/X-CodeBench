    "Problem Statement": "Aryan and Harshith play a game. They both start with three integers $a$, $b$, and $k$. Aryan then gives Harshith two integers $n$ and $m$. Harshith then gives Aryan a matrix $X$ with $n$ rows and $m$ columns, such that each of the elements of $X$ is between $1$ and $k$(inclusive). After that, Aryan wins if he can find a submatrix$^{\\text{∗}}$ $Y$ of $X$ with $a$ rows and $b$ columns such that all elements of $Y$ are equal.\nFor example, when $a=2, b=2, k=6, n=3$ and $m=3$, if Harshith gives Aryan the matrix below, it is a win for Aryan as it has a submatrix of size $2\\times 2$ with all elements equal to $1$ as shown below. ![image](1.png) Example of a matrix where Aryan wins \nAryan gives you the values of $a$, $b$, and $k$. He asks you to find the lexicographically minimum tuple $(n,m)$ that he should give to Harshith such that Aryan always wins. Help Aryan win the game. Assume that Harshith plays optimally. The values of $n$ and $m$ can be large, so output them modulo $10^9+7$. A tuple $(n_1, m_1)$ is said to be lexicographically smaller than $(n_2, m_2)$ if either $n_1<n_2$ or $n_1=n_2$ and $m_1<m_2$.\n$^{\\text{∗}}$A submatrix of a matrix is obtained by removing some rows and/or columns from the original matrix.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. \nEach test case contains a single line with three space-separated integers $a, b$ and $k$ ($1≤ a,b,k≤ 10^5$).\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $\\max(a, b, k)$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$, denoting the answer to the problem. The values of $n$ and $m$ can be large, so output them modulo $10^9+7$.",
