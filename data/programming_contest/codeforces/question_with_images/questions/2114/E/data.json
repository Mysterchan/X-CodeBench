    "Problem Statement": "Once, Kirei stealthily infiltrated the trap-filled estate of the Ainzbern family but was discovered by Kiritugu's familiar. Assessing his strength, Kirei decided to retreat. The estate is represented as a tree with $n$ vertices, with the root at vertex $1$. Each vertex of the tree has a number $a_i$ recorded, which represents the danger of vertex $i$. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.\nFor a successful retreat, Kirei must compute the threat value for each vertex. The threat of a vertex is equal to the maximum alternating sum along the vertical path starting from that vertex. The alternating sum along the vertical path starting from vertex $i$ is defined as $a_i - a_{p_i} + a_{p_{p_i}} - ...$, where $p_i$ is the parent of vertex $i$ on the path to the root (to vertex $1$).\nFor example, in the tree below, vertex $4$ has the following vertical paths:  - $[4]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 = 6$; - $[4, 3]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 = 6 - 2 = 4$; - $[4, 3, 2]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 = 6 - 2 + 5 = 9$; - $[4, 3, 2, 1]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 6 - 2 + 5 - 4 = 5$.  ![image](1.png) The dangers of the vertices are indicated in red. \nHelp Kirei compute the threat values for all vertices and escape the estate.",
