    "Problem Statement": "You are given an unweighted, undirected graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. The graph $G$ contains no self-loops or multiple edges.\nWe denote the node set of $G$ as $V$. For any node subset $V' \\subseteq V$, the corresponding induced subgraph, denoted by $G[V']$, is defined as follows: - $G[V']$ is the graph whose node set is $V'$, and whose edge set consists of all edges in $G$ with both endpoints in $V'$. \nYour task is to answer $q$ queries. Each query provides three integers $l$, $r$, and $k$. Denoting $V'=\\{l,l+1,...,r\\}$, you need to find the $k$-th smallest value among $f(l,G[V'])$, $f(l+1,G[V'])$, $...$ , $f(r,G[V'])$ (i.e., the $k$-th value in increasing order; repeated values are counted multiple times).\nHere, $f(u,G[V'])=\\bigoplus_{(u,v)\\in G[V']}v$. In other words, it is the bitwise XOR value of the labels of all adjacent nodes of node $u$ in graph $G[V']$.\nYou might want to read the notes for a better understanding.",

The description of the test cases follows. \nEach test case begins with two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 ≤ n ≤ 1.5 \\cdot 10^5$, $1 ≤ m ≤ 1.5 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of nodes and edges, respectively. \nThe next $m$ lines each contain two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 ≤ u_i, v_i ≤ n$, $u_i \\neq v_i$), representing an undirected edge between nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$.\nThe next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 ≤ q ≤ 1.5 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries. \nEach of the next $q$ lines contains three integers $l$, $r$, and $k$ ($1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n$, $1 ≤ k ≤ r-l+1$), defining a query about the induced subgraph $G[\\{l,...,r\\}]$.\nIt is guaranteed that the graph contains no self-loops or multiple edges.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$,$m$, and $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $1.5 \\cdot 10^5$, respectively.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output $q$ integers, representing the answer for each query.",

We can see that nodes $1$ and $2$ have no adjacent nodes. Thus, $f(1,G[\\{1,2\\}])=f(2,G[\\{1,2\\}])=0$.
