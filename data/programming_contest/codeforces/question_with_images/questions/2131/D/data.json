    "Problem Statement": "Kagari is preparing to archive a tree, and she knows the cost of doing so will depend on its diameter$^{\\text{∗}}$. To keep the expense down, her goal is to shrink the diameter as much as possible first. She can perform the following operation on the tree: - Choose two vertices $s$ and $t$. Let the sequence of vertices on the simple path$^{\\text{†}}$ from $s$ to $t$ be $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k$, where $v_0 = s$ and $v_k = t$. - Remove all edges along the path. In other words, remove edges $(v_0, v_1), (v_1, v_2), \\dots, (v_{k-1}, v_k)$. - Connect vertices $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k$ directly to $v_0$. In other words, add edges $(v_0, v_1), (v_0, v_2), \\dots, (v_0, v_k)$. \nIt can be shown that the graph is still a tree after the operation.\nHelp her determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve the minimal diameter.\n$^{\\text{∗}}$The diameter of a tree is the longest possible distance between any pair of vertices. The distance itself is measured by the number of edges on the unique simple path connecting them.\n$^{\\text{†}}$A simple path is a path between two vertices in a tree that does not visit any vertex more than once. It can be shown that the simple path between any two vertices is always unique.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \\cdot 10^5$) — the number of the vertices in the tree.\nThe following $n-1$ lines of each test case describe the tree. Each of the lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 ≤ u, v ≤ n$, $u \\neq v$) that indicate an edge between vertex $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\cdot 10^5$. \nOutput\nFor each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of operations to minimize the diameter.",

    "Notes": "Note\nIn the first test case, the diameter of the original tree is $3$. Kagari can perform an operation on $s = 3$ and $t = 4$. As the figure depicts, the operations includes the following steps: - Remove edges $(3, 1)$, $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 4)$. - Add edges $(3, 1)$, $(3, 2)$ and $(3, 4)$.  ![image](1.png) \nAfter the operation, the diameter reduces to $2$. It can be shown that $2$ is the minimum diameter.\nIn the second test case, the diameter of the tree is $1$. It can be shown that $1$ is already the minimum, so Kagari can perform no operation.",
