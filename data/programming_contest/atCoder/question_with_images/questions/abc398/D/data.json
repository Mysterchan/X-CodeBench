    "Problem Statement": "There is an infinitely large two-dimensional grid, with a campfire at coordinate (0,0).\nAt time t=0, smoke exists only at cell (0,0).\nYou are given a length-N string S consisting of N, W, S, E. At times t=1,2,\\dots,N, the following happen in order:\n- Wind blows, and all the smoke present at that time moves as follows:\n- If the t-th character of S is N, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r-1,c).\n- If it is W, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r,c-1).\n- If it is S, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r+1,c).\n- If it is E, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r,c+1).\n- If there is no smoke in cell (0,0), new smoke is generated at cell (0,0).\nTakahashi is standing at cell (R,C).\nFor each integer 1 ≤ t ≤ N, determine if smoke exists at cell (R,C) at time t+0.5, and print the response according to the required format.",

    "Constraints": "- N is an integer between 1 and 200000, inclusive.\n- S is a length N string consisting of N, W, S, E.\n- R and C are integers between -N and N, inclusive.\n- (R,C) \\neq (0,0)",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN R C\nS\nOutput\nPrint an N-character string consisting of 0 and 1.\nThe t-th character (1 ≤ t ≤ N) should be:\n- 1 if smoke exists at cell (R,C) at time t+0.5, and\n- 0 otherwise.",
