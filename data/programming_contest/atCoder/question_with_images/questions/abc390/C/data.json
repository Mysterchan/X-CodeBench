    "Problem Statement": "You are given a grid of H rows and W columns.\nLet (i,j) denote the cell at row i (1 ≤ i ≤ H) from the top and column j (1 ≤ j ≤ W) from the left.\nThe state of the grid is represented by H strings S_1, S_2, ..., S_H, each of length W, as follows:\n- If the j-th character of S_i is #, cell (i,j) is painted black.\n- If the j-th character of S_i is ., cell (i,j) is painted white.\n- If the j-th character of S_i is ?, cell (i,j) is not yet painted.\nTakahashi wants to paint each not-yet-painted cell white or black so that all the black cells form a rectangle.\nMore precisely, he wants there to exist a quadruple of integers (a,b,c,d) (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ H, 1 ≤ c ≤ d ≤ W) such that:\nFor each cell (i,j) (1 ≤ i ≤ H, 1 ≤ j ≤ W),\nif a ≤ i ≤ b and c ≤ j ≤ d, the cell is black;\notherwise, the cell is white.\nDetermine whether this is possible.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ H, W ≤ 1000\n- H and W are integers.\n- Each S_i is a string of length W consisting of #, ., ?.\n- There is at least one cell that is already painted black.",

            "explanation": "To form a rectangle with all black cells, you would need to paint cell (2,2) black, but it is already painted white.\r\nTherefore, it is impossible to make all black cells form a rectangle, so print No.",
