    "Problem Statement": "There are N equally spaced points on a circle labeled clockwise as 1,2,...,N.\nThere are M distinct lines, where the i-th line passes through two distinct points A_i and B_i (1 ≤ i ≤ M).\nFind the number of pairs (i,j) satisfying:\n- 1 ≤ i < j ≤ M, and\n- the i-th and j-th lines intersect.",
