    "Problem Statement": "There are two grids S and T, each with N rows and N columns. Let (i,j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.\nEach cell of grids S and T is colored either white or black. Cell (i,j) of S is white if S_{i,j} is ., and black if S_{i,j} is #. The same applies to T.\nYou may perform the following two types of operations any number of times in any order. Find the minimum number of operations required to make grid S identical to grid T.\n- Choose one cell of grid S and change its color.\n- Rotate the entire grid S 90 degrees clockwise.",
