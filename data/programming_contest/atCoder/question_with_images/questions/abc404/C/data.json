    "Problem Statement": "You are given a simple undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1,2,\\dots,N and the edges are numbered 1,2,\\dots,M. Edge i connects vertices A_i and B_i.\nDetermine whether this graph is a cycle graph.\nDefinition of simple undirected graph\nA simple undirected graph is a graph with undirected edges without self-loops or multi-edges.\nDefinition of cycle graph\nAn N-vertex graph with vertices labeled 1,2,\\dots,N is a cycle graph when there exists a permutation (v_1,v_2,\\dots,v_N) of (1,2,\\dots,N) such that:\n- For each i = 1,2,\\dots,N-1, there is an edge between vertices v_i and v_{i+1}. \n- There is an edge between vertices v_N and v_1. \n- No other edges exist.",
