    "Problem Statement": "There are N points on a two-dimensional plane, with the i-th point at coordinates (X_i, Y_i). It is guaranteed that no two points are at the same position, and no three points are collinear.\nAmong the combinations of four points from these points, how many combinations can form a trapezoid as a polygon with those four points as vertices?",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 4 ≤ N ≤ 2\\,000\n- 0 ≤ X_i, Y_i ≤ 10^7 (1 ≤ i ≤ N)\n- No two points are at the same location.\n- No three points are collinear.\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nX_1 Y_1\r\n\\vdots\r\nX_N Y_N\r\nOutput\nPrint the answer on one line.",

            "explanation": "The given points are arranged as shown in the figure below.\n\n![image](1.png)\n\nAmong the combinations of four points, the following three combinations can form a trapezoid as a polygon with those points as vertices:\n\n- The 1st, 5th, 4th, 3rd points.\n- The 1st, 3rd, 4th, 2nd points.\n- The 1st, 2nd, 5th, 4th points.\n\n\nNote that parallelograms and rectangles are also treated as trapezoids.",
