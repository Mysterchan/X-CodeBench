    "Problem Statement": "There is a grid with 10^9 rows and W columns. The cell at the x-th column from the left and the y-th row from the bottom is denoted by (x,y).\nThere are N blocks. Each block is a 1 \\times 1 square, and block i-th (1 ≤ i ≤ N) is located at cell (X_i,Y_i) at time 0.\nAt times t=1,2,\\dots,10^{100}, the blocks are moved according to the following rules:\n- If the entire bottom row is filled with blocks, then all blocks in the bottom row are removed.\n- For each remaining block, in order from bottom to top, perform the following:\n- If the block is in the bottom row, or if there is a block in the cell immediately below it, do nothing.\n- Otherwise, move the block one cell downward.\nYou are given Q queries. For the j-th query (1 ≤ j ≤ Q), answer whether block A_j exists at time T_j+0.5.",
