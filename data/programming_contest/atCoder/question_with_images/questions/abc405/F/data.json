    "Problem Statement": "On a circle, 2N points are placed at equal intervals and numbered 1,2,\\dots,2N in clockwise order starting from an arbitrary point.\nThere are M line segments numbered 1,2,\\dots,M connecting these points. Segment i connects points A_i and B_i.\nHere, A_i and B_i are distinct even numbers.\nIt is guaranteed that no two of these segments share a point.\nProcess Q queries. The j‑th query is as follows:\n- You are given two distinct odd numbers C_j and D_j. Among the M segments 1,2,\\dots,M, find how many share a point with the segment connecting points C_j and D_j.",
