    "Problem Statement": "There are N mochi (rice cakes) arranged in ascending order of size.\nThe size of the i-th mochi (1 ≤ i ≤ N) is A_i.\nGiven two mochi A and B, with sizes a and b respectively, you can make one kagamimochi (a stacked rice cake) by placing mochi A on top of mochi B if and only if a is at most half of b.\nYou choose two mochi out of the N mochi, and place one on top of the other to form one kagamimochi.\nFind how many different kinds of kagamimochi can be made.\nTwo kagamimochi are distinguished if at least one of the mochi is different, even if the sizes of the mochi are the same.",
