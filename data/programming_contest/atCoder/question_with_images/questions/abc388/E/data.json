    "Problem Statement": "There are N mochi (rice cakes), arranged in ascending order of size.\nThe size of the i-th mochi (1≤ i≤ N) is A_i.\nGiven two mochi A and B, with sizes a and b respectively, you can make one kagamimochi (a stacked rice cake) by placing mochi A on top of mochi B if and only if a is at most half of b.\nFind how many kagamimochi can be made simultaneously.\nMore precisely, find the maximum non-negative integer K for which the following is possible:\n- From the N mochi, choose 2K of them to form K pairs. For each pair, place one mochi on top of the other, to make K kagamimochi.",
