    "Problem Statement": "There is a grid with H rows and W columns.\nLet (i,j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top (1≤ i≤ H) and the j-th column from the left (1≤ j≤ W).\nCell (i,j)\\ (1≤ i≤ H,1≤ j≤ W) has a non-negative integer A_{i,j} written on it.\nLet us place zero or more dominoes on the grid.\nA domino covers two adjacent cells, namely one of the following pairs:\n- cells (i,j) and (i,j+1) for 1≤ i≤ H,1≤ j\\lt W;\n- cells (i,j) and (i+1,j) for 1≤ i\\lt H,1≤ j≤ W.\nNo cell may be covered by more than one domino.\nFor a placement of dominoes, define its score as the bitwise XOR of all integers written in cells not covered by any domino.\nFind the maximum possible score.\nWhat is bitwise XOR?\n For non-negative integers A and B, their bitwise XOR A \\oplus B is defined as follows:\n \n- In binary, the 2^k bit (k ≥ 0) of A \\oplus B is 1 if exactly one of A and B has 1 in that bit, and 0 otherwise.\n For example, 3 \\oplus 5 = 6 (in binary, 011 \\oplus 101 = 110).\n For k non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_k, their bitwise XOR is (\\dots ((p_1 \\oplus p_2) \\oplus p_3) \\oplus \\dots \\oplus p_k), which can be proved to be independent of the order of the operands.",
