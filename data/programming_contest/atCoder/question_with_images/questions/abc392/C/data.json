    "Problem Statement": "There are N people numbered from 1 to N.\nPerson i is wearing a bib with the number Q_i and is staring at person P_i.\nFor each i = 1,2,...,N, find the number written on the bib of the person that the person wearing the bib with number i is staring at.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 2 ≤ N ≤ 3\\times 10^5\n- 1 ≤ P_i ≤ N\n- The values of P_i are distinct.\n- 1 ≤ Q_i ≤ N\n- The values of Q_i are distinct.\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nP_1 P_2 \\dots P_N\r\nQ_1 Q_2 \\dots Q_N\r\nOutput\nLet S_i be the number written on the bib of the person that the person wearing the bib with number i is staring at.\r\nPrint S_1, S_2, ..., S_N in this order, separated by a single space.",
