    "Problem Statement": "There is a grid with H rows and W columns. We call the cell at the i-th row from the top (1≤ i≤ H) and j-th column from the left (1≤ j≤ W) as cell (i,j).\nInitially, cell (i,j) is colored black if S_{i,j} is # and white if it is ..\nPerform the following operation 10^{100} times:\n- Let T be the set of cells that are colored white and have exactly one adjacent cell colored black. Color each cell in T black. Here, two cells (i_1,j_1) and (i_2,j_2) are adjacent if and only if |i_1-i_2|+|j_1-j_2|=1.\nFind the number of cells that are colored black after all operations are completed.",
