    "Problem Statement": "There is an N \\times N grid. Let (i,j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left.\nFor K = 1, 2, ..., N, a level K L-shape is a set of 2K - 1 cells that satisfies at least one of the following four conditions:\n- All cells reachable from a certain cell (i,j) by moving down or right between 0 and K-1 cells, inclusive (where 1 ≤ i ≤ N-K+1, 1 ≤ j ≤ N-K+1).\n- All cells reachable from a certain cell (i,j) by moving down or left between 0 and K-1 cells, inclusive (where 1 ≤ i ≤ N-K+1, K ≤ j ≤ N).\n- All cells reachable from a certain cell (i,j) by moving up or right between 0 and K-1 cells, inclusive (where K ≤ i ≤ N, 1 ≤ j ≤ N-K+1).\n- All cells reachable from a certain cell (i,j) by moving up or left between 0 and K-1 cells, inclusive (where K ≤ i ≤ N, K ≤ j ≤ N).\nYou are given a cell (a,b) and Q queries k_1, ..., k_Q.\nFor each i, print the number, modulo 998244353, of ways to partition the entire grid into exactly one level 1 L-shape, one level 2 L-shape, ..., and one level N L-shape so that cell (a,b) is contained in the level k_i L-shape.",
