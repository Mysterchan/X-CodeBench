    "Problem Statement": "There is a H \\times W grid, and each cell contains 0 or 1. The cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left contains an integer A_{i,j}.\nYou can perform the following two operations any number of times in any order:\n- Operation X: Choose an integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ H). For every integer 1 ≤ y ≤ W, replace A_{x,y} with 1 - A_{x,y}.\n- Operation Y: Choose an integer y (1 ≤ y ≤ W). For every integer 1 ≤ x ≤ H, replace A_{x,y} with 1 - A_{x,y}.\nFind the minimum possible value of \\displaystyle \\sum_{x=1}^H\\sum_{y=1}^W A_{x,y} after the process.",

    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ H ≤ 2\\times 10^5\n- 1 ≤ W ≤ 18\n- H and W are integers.\n- A_{i,1}A_{i,2}... A_{i,W} is a length-W string consisting of 0 and 1.",

            "explanation": "By performing the following operations, the grid changes as shown below, and you get \\displaystyle \\sum_{x=1}^H\\sum_{y=1}^W A_{x,y} = 2.\n\n- Operation Y with y=1\n- Operation X with x=2\n\n\n![image](1.png)\n\nIt is impossible to make \\displaystyle \\sum_{x=1}^H\\sum_{y=1}^W A_{x,y} ≤ 1, so the answer is 2.",
