    "Problem Statement": "There is an H \\times W grid.\nLet (i,j) denote the cell at the i-th row (1≤ i≤ H) from the top and j-th column (1≤ j≤ W) from the left.\nEach cell in the grid either has an obstacle placed on it or has nothing placed on it. There are K cells with obstacles: cells (r_1,c_1),(r_2,c_2),...,(r_K,c_K).\nTakahashi is initially at cell (1,1) and wants to reach cell (H,W) by repeatedly moving to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) that has nothing placed on it.\nMore precisely, he can repeat the following operation as many times as he likes:\n- Choose one of the following four operations and perform the chosen operation:\n- If 1\\lt i and cell (i-1,j) has nothing placed on it, move to cell (i-1,j). Otherwise, do not move.\n- If 1\\lt j and cell (i,j-1) has nothing placed on it, move to cell (i,j-1). Otherwise, do not move.\n- If i\\lt H and cell (i+1,j) has nothing placed on it, move to cell (i+1,j). Otherwise, do not move.\n- If j\\lt W and cell (i,j+1) has nothing placed on it, move to cell (i,j+1). Otherwise, do not move.\nDetermine whether he can move from cell (1,1) to cell (H,W).",
