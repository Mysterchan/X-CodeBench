    "Problem Statement": "You are given a directed graph with N vertices and M edges.\nThe i-th edge (1 ≤ i ≤ M) is a directed edge from vertex u _ i to vertex v _ i.\nInitially, you are at vertex 1. You want to repeat the following operations until you reach vertex N:\n- Perform one of the two operations below:\n- Move along a directed edge from your current vertex. This incurs a cost of 1. More precisely, if you are at vertex v, choose a vertex u such that there is a directed edge from v to u, and move to vertex u.\n- Reverse the direction of all edges. This incurs a cost of X. More precisely, if and only if there was a directed edge from v to u immediately before this operation, there is a directed edge from u to v immediately after this operation.\nIt is guaranteed that, for the given graph, you can reach vertex N from vertex 1 by repeating these operations.\nFind the minimum total cost required to reach vertex N.",
