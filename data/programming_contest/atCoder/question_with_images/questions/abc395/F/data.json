    "Problem Statement": "Takahashi has 2N teeth: N upper teeth and N lower teeth.\nThe length of the i-th upper tooth from the left (1 ≤ i ≤ N) is U _ i, and the length of the i-th lower tooth from the left (1 ≤ i ≤ N) is D _ i.\nHis teeth are said to “fit together well” if both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n- There exists an integer H such that U _ i + D _ i = H for every integer i with 1 ≤ i ≤ N.\n- \\lvert U _ i - U _ {i+1} \\rvert ≤ X for every integer i with 1 ≤ i < N.\nHe can perform the following operation any number of times:\n- Pay 1 yen to use a tooth-grinding machine, choose exactly one tooth whose length is positive, and reduce its length by 1.\nNo other method may be used to change the lengths of the teeth.\nFind the minimum total amount of money he needs to pay to make his teeth fit together well.",
