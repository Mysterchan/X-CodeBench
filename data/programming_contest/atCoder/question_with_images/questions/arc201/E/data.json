    "Problem Statement": "There are N points numbered 1,2, \\dots, N on the 2-dimensional plane.\nThe coordinates of point i are (i,Y_i).\nIn this problem, it is guaranteed that Y=(Y_1,Y_2,\\dots ,Y_N) is a permutation of (1,2, \\dots ,N).\nFind the sum of the areas of bounding boxes for all subsets S of \\lbrace \\texttt{point}\\,1,\\texttt{point}\\,2,\\dots ,\\texttt{point}\\,N \\rbrace with at least 2 elements, modulo 998244353.\nThe bounding box for S refers to the minimum area rectangle with sides parallel to the x-axis that contains all points in S inside or on the boundary.",
