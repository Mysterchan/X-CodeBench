    "Problem Statement": "There is a connected undirected graph with N vertices and M edges.\nThe vertices are numbered vertex 1, vertex 2,..., vertex N, and the i-th edge (1≤ i≤ M) connects vertices u _ i and v _ i.\nFor i=1,2,...,N, solve the following problem:\nInitially, Takahashi's weight is 0.\nHe travels by car to visit vertex 1 and moves toward vertex i.\nWhen he visits vertex v\\ (1≤ v≤ N), his weight increases by W _ v.\nThe car he is riding can move along the edges.\nWhen he passes through an edge, letting X be his weight at that time, the car consumes X fuel.\nFind the minimum amount of fuel consumed for him to reach vertex i.",

            "explanation": "The given graph is as follows:\n\n![image](1.png)\n\nFor example, Takahashi can reach vertex 5 by visiting vertex 1 and then acting as follows:\n\n- He visits vertex 1. His weight increases by 3, becoming 3.\n- He consumes 3 fuel to move to vertex 3. His weight increases by 4, becoming 7.\n- He consumes 7 fuel to move to vertex 5. His weight increases by 5, becoming 12.\n\n\n![image](2.png)\n\nBy acting this way, he can reach vertex 5 by consuming 10 fuel.\r\nIt is impossible to reduce the fuel consumption to 9 or less, so output 10 on the 5th line.",
