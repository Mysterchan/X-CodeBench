    "Problem Statement": "You are given an N\\times N matrix A = (A_{i,j}) (1≤ i,j≤ N) whose entries are 0 or 1.\nFind, modulo 998244353, the number of trees G on N vertices numbered 1 to N that satisfy the following condition.\n- A_{i,j}=1 if and only if at least one of the following holds:\n- When G is rooted at vertex 1, Vertex j is an ancestor of vertex i. That is, vertex j lies on the unique path in G between vertices 1 and i.\n- When G is rooted at vertex 1, Vertex i is an ancestor of vertex j. That is, vertex i lies on the unique path in G between vertices 1 and j.\nHere, the endpoints of a path are considered to be on that path. Note that G being a tree guarantees uniqueness of the path between any two vertices.\nThere are T test cases; solve each one.",
