    "Problem Statement": "There is an H\\times W grid of cells. Let (h,w) denote the cell at the h-th row from the top and the w-th column from the left. Furthermore, you are given a string S = S_1\\cdots S_{H+W-2} of length H+W-2 consisting of D, R, and ?.\nInitially, all cells are painted white. You may perform the following operation, which consists of three steps, any number of times:\n- Choose a string X = X_1\\cdots X_{H+W-2} of length H+W-2 satisfying all of the following.\n- X consists of exactly H-1 Ds and W-1 Rs.\n- For each 1 ≤ i ≤ H+W-2, if S_i is D then X_i must also be D.\n- For each 1 ≤ i ≤ H+W-2, if S_i is R then X_i must also be R.\n- Stand on cell (1,1). Then for i=1,2,... in order, move one cell in the direction indicated by X_i: if X_i is D, move down one cell; if X_i is R, move right one cell. It can be shown that if X satisfies the conditions in step 1, the destination cell always exists within the grid.\n- For every cell you visited in step 2 (including the starting and ending cells), if the cell is currently white, paint it black.\nFind the maximum possible number of cells that can be painted black in total.\nThere are T test cases; solve each one.",

    "Constraints": "- 1≤ T≤ 2\\times 10^5\n- 2≤ H,W≤ 2\\times 10^5\n- T,H,W are integers.\n- S is a string of length H+W-2 consisting of D, R, and ?.\n- The number of Ds in S is at most H-1.\n- The number of Rs in S is at most W-1.\n- The sum of H+W over all test cases is at most 4\\times 10^5.",
