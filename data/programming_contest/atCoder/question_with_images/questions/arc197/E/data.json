    "Problem Statement": "You are given positive integers N, H, and W, with H,W ≤ 3N-1.\nFind the number, modulo 998244353, of ways to place four N\\times N square tiles on an H\\times W grid that satisfy all of the following conditions.\n- Each tile exactly covers N^2 cells of the grid.\n- No cell is covered by more than one tile.\nHere, the tiles are indistinguishable.\nThere are T test cases; solve each one.",

    "Constraints": "- 1≤ T≤ 2\\times 10^5\n- 1≤ N,H,W≤ 10^9\n- H,W≤ 3N-1\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nT\n\\text{case}_1\n\\vdots\n\\text{case}_T\nEach case is given in the following format:\nN H W\nOutput\nPrint T lines. The i-th line should contain the number, modulo 998244353, of valid ways to place the tiles for the i-th test case.",
