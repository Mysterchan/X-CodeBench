    "Problem Statement": "There is an N\\times N board, where N is at least 4. The cells on the outermost edge of the board that are not corners are called good cells. More formally, among (i,j) such that 1≤ i,j ≤ N and i=1 or i=N or j=1 or j=N, the cells excluding (1,1),(1,N),(N,1),(N,N) are called good cells. Here, (r,c) refers to the cell in row r and column c.\nAll good cells have integers written on them. This information is given as four integer sequences of length N-2: U=(U_1,...,U_{N-2}),D=(D_1,...,D_{N-2}),L=(L_1,...,L_{N-2}),R=(R_1,...,R_{N-2}).\nEach element of these integer sequences corresponds to the integer written on a good cell as follows:\n- U_i: (1,i+1)\n- D_i: (N,i+1)\n- L_i: (i+1,1)\n- R_i: (i+1,N)\nAlso, all cells on the board are initially colored white. You can perform the following operation any number of times:\n- Choose two good cells that have never been chosen in any previous operation. Let the two chosen good cells be (r_1,c_1) and (r_2,c_2). For all (i,j) satisfying \\min(r_1,r_2)≤ i ≤ \\max(r_1,r_2) and \\min(c_1,c_2)≤ j ≤ \\max(c_1,c_2), color (i,j) black.\nThe cost of the operation is the sum of the integers written on the two chosen good cells.\nFind the minimum total cost required to color all cells black.\nAnswer for T test cases.",
