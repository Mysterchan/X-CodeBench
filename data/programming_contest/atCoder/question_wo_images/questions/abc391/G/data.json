    "Problem Statement": "You are given a lowercase English string S of length N and an integer M. For each k=0,1,...,N, solve the following problem:\n- There are 26^M lowercase English strings of length M. Among these, find the number, modulo 998244353, of strings whose longest common subsequence with S has length exactly k.",
