    "Time Limit": "2 sec",
    "Memory Limit": "1024 MiB",
    "Problem Statement": "There are N pigeons numbered from 1 to N, and there are N nests numbered from 1 to N. Initially, pigeon i is in nest i for 1≤ i≤ N.\nYou are given Q queries, which you must process in order. There are two types of queries, each given in one of the following formats:\n- 1 P H : Move pigeon P to nest H.\n- 2 : Output the number of nests that contain more than one pigeon.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 2 ≤ N ≤ 10^6\n- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 3\\times 10^5\n- 1 ≤ P, H ≤ N\n- For a query of the first type, pigeon P is not in nest H before the move.\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN Q\r\n\\mathrm{query}_1\r\n\\mathrm{query}_2\r\n\\vdots\r\n\\mathrm{query}_Q\r\nEach query is given in one of the following two formats:\n1 P H\r\n2\r\nOutput\nPrint the answer to each query on a new line according to the instructions in the problem statement.",

            "explanation": "Initially, pigeons 1,2,3,4 are in nests 1,2,3,4, respectively.\n\n- For the 1st query, the counts of pigeons in nests 1,2,3,4 are 1,1,1,1. No nests contain multiple pigeons, output 0.\n- For the 2nd query, move pigeon 1 to nest 2.\n- For the 3rd query, the counts become 0,2,1,1, respectively. One nest (nest 2) contains multiple pigeons, so output 1.\n- For the 4th query, move pigeon 3 to nest 2.\n- For the 5th query, the counts become 0,3,0,1, respectively. One nest (nest 2) contains multiple pigeons, so output 1.\n- For the 6th query, move pigeon 3 to nest 4.\n- For the 7th query, the counts become 0,2,0,2, respectively. Two nests (nests 2 and 4) contain multiple pigeons, so output 2.",
