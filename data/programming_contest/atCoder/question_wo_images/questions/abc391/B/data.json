    "Problem Statement": "You are given an N \\times N grid S and an M \\times M grid T. The cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is denoted by (i,j).\nThe colors of the cells in S and T are represented by N^2 characters S_{i,j} (1≤ i,j≤ N) and M^2 characters T_{i,j} (1≤ i,j≤ M), respectively. In grid S, cell (i,j) is white if S_{i,j} is ., and black if S_{i,j} is #. The same applies for grid T.\nFind T within S. More precisely, output integers a and b (1 ≤ a,b ≤ N-M+1) that satisfy the following condition:\n- S_{a+i-1,b+j-1} = T_{i,j} for every i,j (1≤ i,j ≤ M).",
