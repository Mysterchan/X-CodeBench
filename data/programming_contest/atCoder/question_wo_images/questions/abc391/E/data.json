    "Problem Statement": "For a binary string B = B_1 B_2 \\dots B_{3^n} of length 3^n (n ≥ 1), we define an operation to obtain a binary string C = C_1 C_2 \\dots C_{3^{n-1}} of length 3^{n-1} as follows:\n- Partition the elements of B into groups of 3 and take the majority value from each group. That is, for i=1,2,\\dots,3^{n-1}, let C_i be the value that appears most frequently among B_{3i-2}, B_{3i-1}, and B_{3i}.\nYou are given a binary string A = A_1 A_2 \\dots A_{3^N} of length 3^N. Let A' = A'_1 be the length-1 string obtained by applying the above operation N times to A.\nDetermine the minimum number of elements of A that must be changed (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) in order to change the value of A'_1.",

            "output": "1\n",
            "explanation": "For example, with A=010011101, after applying the operation twice, we obtain:\n\n- First operation: The majority of 010 is 0, of 011 is 1, and of 101 is 1, resulting in 011.\n- Second operation: The majority of 011 is 1, yielding 1.\n\n\nTo change the final value from 1 to 0, one way is to change the 5th character of A from 1 to 0, yielding A=010001101. After the change, the operations yield:\n\n- First operation: The majority of 010 is 0, of 001 is 0, and of 101 is 1, resulting in 001.\n- Second operation: The majority of 001 is 0, yielding 0.\n\n\nThus, the minimum number of changes required is 1.",
