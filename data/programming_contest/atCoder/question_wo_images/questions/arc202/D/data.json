    "Problem Statement": "There is a shogi (Japanese chess) board with H rows and W columns, and one king piece. The square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left of the board is represented as (i, j).\nInitially, the king is placed at (A, B). You perform the following operation exactly T times.\n- Move the king to one of the eight adjacent squares of the current square. More precisely, if the king is at square (i, j), move the king to one of (i+1,j+1), (i+1,j), (i+1,j-1), (i,j+1), (i,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i-1,j), (i-1,j-1). The king cannot leave the board.\nFind the number, modulo 998244353, of operation sequences such that the king is at (C, D) after completing all T operations. Two operation sequences are considered different if and only if there exists an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ T) such that the king's position after the i-th operation is different.",
