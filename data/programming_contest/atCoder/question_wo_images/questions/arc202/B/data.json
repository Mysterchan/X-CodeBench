    "Problem Statement": "There is a shogi (Japanese chess) board with H rows and W columns, and one knight piece. The square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left of the board is represented as (i-1, j-1). (Note that the values are shifted by 1.)\nThis board is a torus, meaning the top and bottom are connected, and the left and right are connected. A knight at (i, j) can move to ((i-2) \\bmod H, (j-1) \\bmod W) or ((i-2) \\bmod H, (j+1) \\bmod W). (Note that this is different from the knight in Standard chess.)\nMoving the knight on the board to satisfy the following condition is called a tour.\n- Initially, place the knight at (0, 0). Then, move the knight H \\times W times so that the knight visits every square exactly once. Finally, the knight returns to (0, 0).\nFind the number of tours modulo 998244353. Two tours are considered different if and only if there exists an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ H\\times W) such that the destination of the i-th move is different.",
