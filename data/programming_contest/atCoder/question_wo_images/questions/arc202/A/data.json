    "Problem Statement": "An integer sequence that satisfies the following condition is called a good sequence.\n- It is possible to perform the following merge operation zero or more times to make the sequence length 1.\n- Choose a location where two consecutive elements have equal values. Let x be the value of those elements. Remove both elements and insert x+1 at the location where the elements were.\nFor example, if we perform a merge operation on the 2nd and 3rd elements of the sequence (1, 3, 3, 5), the sequence after the operation will be (1, 4, 5).\nThere is a length-N integer sequence A = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N).\nYou can perform the following insertion operation zero or more times.\n- Choose any integer x. Insert one x at any position in A (possibly the beginning or end).\nWhat is the minimum number of insertion operations needed to make A a good sequence? For any N and A satisfying the constraints, it is possible to make A a good sequence with a finite number of insertion operations.\nYou are given T test cases; solve the problem for each of them.",

            "explanation": "For the 1st test case, the sequence (4, 2, 2, 3) obtained by inserting 3 at the end of A is a good sequence because it can be reduced to length 1 by performing merge operations in the following steps.\n\n- Remove the 2s at the 2nd and 3rd positions and insert 2+1=3. The sequence becomes (4, 3, 3).\n- Remove the 3s at the 2nd and 3rd positions and insert 3+1=4. The sequence becomes (4, 4).\n- Remove the 4s at the 1st and 2nd positions and insert 4+1=5. The sequence becomes (5).\n\n\nIt is impossible to make A a good sequence with fewer than one insertion operation, so the answer is 1.",
