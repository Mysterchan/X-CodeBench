    "Problem Statement": "There are N squares arranged in a row, labeled 1, 2, ..., N from left to right.\nYou are given M pairs of integers (L_1, R_1), ..., (L_M, R_M).\nA square j is defined to be bad if and only if there exists some i such that L_i ≤ j ≤ R_i.\nDetermine whether you can move from square 1 to square N by repeatedly performing the following action:\n- Let your current square be x. Choose an integer i that satisfies all of the following conditions, and move to square x + i.\n- A ≤ i ≤ B\n- x + i ≤ N\n- Square x + i is not bad.",
