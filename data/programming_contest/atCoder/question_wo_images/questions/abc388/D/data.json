    "Problem Statement": "On a certain planet, there are N aliens, all of whom are minors.\nThe i-th alien currently has A_i stones, and will become an adult exactly i years later.\nWhen someone becomes an adult on this planet, every adult who has at least one stone gives exactly one stone as a congratulatory gift to the alien who has just become an adult.\nFind how many stones each alien will have after N years.\nAssume that no new aliens will be born in the future.",
