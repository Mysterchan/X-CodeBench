    "Problem Statement": "Determine whether there exists a sequence A=(A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_{X+Y+Z}) of length X+Y+Z that contains exactly X zeros, Y ones, and Z twos, and satisfies the following condition:\n- For every i(1 ≤ i ≤ X+Y+Z), exactly A_i numbers among A_{i-1} and A_{i+1} are less than A_i.\nHere, assume A_0 = A_{X+Y+Z} and A_{X+Y+Z+1} = A_1.\nYou are given T test cases. Solve each of them.",
