    "Problem Statement": "You are given a positive integer N and sequences of positive integers of length N: L=(L_1,L_2,...,L_N),R=(R_1,R_2,...,R_N). It is guaranteed that L_1,L_2,...,L_N,R_1,R_2,...,R_N are all distinct.\nA movie theater has N seats arranged in a row from left to right. The i-th seat from the left is called seat i.\nN people, numbered 1 to N, visit this movie theater. You assign one seat to each person. Let P_i be the seat assigned to person i. Then, person i arrives at time L_i, crosses seats 1,2,...,P_i-1 to sit in seat P_i, and leaves at time R_i, crossing seats 1,2,...,P_i-1 to exit.\nThe dissatisfaction of person i is the number of times other people cross seat P_i during the time interval from time L_i to time R_i (not including exactly L_i and R_i).\nFind the lexicographically smallest permutation P of (1,2,...,N) that minimizes the total dissatisfaction of all people from 1 to N.\nYou are given T test cases, so find the answer for each.",

            "explanation": "For the first test case, if we set P=(2,1,3), the process proceeds as follows:\n\n- Time 1: Person 1 sits in seat 2.\n- Time 2: Person 2 sits in seat 1.\n- Time 3: Person 2 leaves seat 1.\n- Time 4: Person 3 sits in seat 3. Person 1's dissatisfaction increases by 1.\n- Time 5: Person 1 leaves seat 2.\n- Time 6: Person 3 leaves seat 3.\n\n\nThe total dissatisfaction of all people in this case is 1.\n\nIt is impossible to make the total dissatisfaction smaller than 1, and furthermore, P=(2,1,3) is lexicographically smallest among all P with total dissatisfaction of 1. Therefore, P=(2,1,3) is the answer.\n\nFor the second test case, the total dissatisfaction of all people is 6 for any permutation P.",
