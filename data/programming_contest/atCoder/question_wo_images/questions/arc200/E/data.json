    "Problem Statement": "You are given positive integers N,M.\nFind the number, modulo 998244353, of non-negative integer sequences A=(A_1,A_2,...,A_N) of length N that satisfy all the following conditions.\n- 0≤ A_i < 2^M (1≤ i≤ N)\n- \\operatorname{popcount}(A_i\\oplus A_j) ≤ 2 (1≤ i < j≤ N)\nHere, for non-negative integers x,y, we denote by x\\oplus y the bitwise \\mathrm{XOR} operation of x and y, and by \\operatorname{popcount}(x) the popcount of x.\nYou are given T test cases, so find the answer for each.\n What is bitwise \\mathrm{XOR} operation?\n \n The bitwise \\mathrm{XOR} of non-negative integers A, B, denoted A \\oplus B, is defined as follows.\n \n- When A \\oplus B is written in binary, the digit in the 2^k (k ≥ 0) place is 1 if exactly one of A, B has 1 in the 2^k place when written in binary, and 0 otherwise.\n For example, 3 \\oplus 5 = 6 (in binary: 011 \\oplus 101 = 110). \n \nWhat is popcount?\nFor a non-negative integer x, \\operatorname{popcount}(x) is the number of 1s when x is written in binary. More precisely, for a non-negative integer x such that \\displaystyle x=\\sum _ {i=0} ^ \\infty b _ i2 ^ i\\ (b _ i\\in\\lbrace0,1\\rbrace), we have \\displaystyle\\operatorname{popcount}(x)=\\sum _ {i=0} ^ \\infty b _ i.\nFor example, 13 in binary is 1101, so we have \\operatorname{popcount}(13)=3.",

            "explanation": "Consider the first test case.\n\nFor example, A=(4,5) satisfies the conditions because each element is between 0 and 2^3-1=7, and \\operatorname{popcount}(4\\oplus 5)=\\operatorname{popcount}(1)=1≤ 2. On the other hand, neither A=(2,5) nor A=(0,7) satisfies the conditions.\n\nThere are 56 sequences A that satisfy the conditions, so output 56 on the first line.",
