    "Problem Statement": "You are given an undirected tree T with N vertices, numbered 1, 2, ..., N. The i-th edge is an undirected edge connecting vertices A_i and B_i.\nA graph is defined to be an alkane if and only if it satisfies the following conditions:\n- The graph is an undirected tree.\n- Every vertex has degree 1 or 4, and there is at least one vertex of degree 4.\nDetermine whether there exists a subgraph of T that is an alkane, and if so, find the maximum number of vertices in such a subgraph.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 \\times 10^5\n- 1 ≤ A_i, B_i ≤ N\n- The given graph is an undirected tree.\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nA_1 B_1\r\nA_2 B_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nA_{N - 1} B_{N - 1}\r\nOutput\nIf there exists a subgraph of T that is an alkane, print the maximum number of vertices in such a subgraph. Otherwise, print -1.",
