    "Problem Statement": "You are given a string S consisting of six types of characters: (, ), [, ], <, >.\nA string T is called a colorful bracket sequence if it satisfies the following condition:\nIt is possible to turn T into an empty string by repeating the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n- If there exists a contiguous substring of T that is one of (), [], or <>, choose one such substring and delete it.\n- If the deleted substring was at the beginning or end of T, the remainder becomes the new T.\n- Otherwise, concatenate the part before the deleted substring and the part after the deleted substring, and that becomes the new T.\nDetermine whether S is a colorful bracket sequence.",

            "output": "Yes\n",
            "explanation": "For S=([])<>(), it is possible to turn it into an empty string by repeating the operation as follows:\n\n- Delete the substring [] from the 2nd to the 3rd character in ([])<>(), then concatenate the parts before and after it. The string becomes ()<>().\n- Delete the substring () from the 1st to the 2nd character in ()<>(). The string becomes <>().\n- Delete the substring <> from the 1st to the 2nd character in <>(). The string becomes ().\n- Delete the substring () from the 1st to the 2nd character in (). The string becomes empty.\n\n\nThus, S=([])<>() is a colorful bracket sequence, so print Yes.",
