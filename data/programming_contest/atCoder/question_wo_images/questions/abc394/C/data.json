    "Problem Statement": "You are given a string S consisting of uppercase English letters.\nApply the following procedure to S, and then output the resulting string:\nAs long as the string contains WA as a (contiguous) substring, repeat the following operation:\n- Among all occurrences of WA in the string, replace the leftmost one with AC.\nIt can be proved under the constraints of this problem that this operation is repeated at most a finite number of times.",

    "Constraints": "- S is a string of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 3\\times 10^5, inclusive.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\nOutput\nPrint the resulting string after performing the procedure described in the problem statement on S.",

            "explanation": "Initially, the string is S= WACWA.\nThis string contains WA as a substring in two places: from the 1st to the 2nd character, and from the 4th to the 5th character.\nIn the first operation, we replace the leftmost occurrence (the substring from the 1st to the 2nd character) with AC, resulting in ACCWA.\nAfter the first operation, the string contains WA as a substring in exactly one place: from the 4th to the 5th character.\nIn the second operation, we replace it with AC, resulting in ACCAC.\nSince ACCAC does not contain WA as a substring, the procedure ends. Therefore, we output ACCAC.",
