    "Problem Statement": "You are given N strings S_1, S_2, ..., S_N, each consisting of lowercase English letters. The lengths of these strings are all distinct.\nSort these strings in ascending order of length, and then concatenate them in that order to form a single string.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 2 ≤ N ≤ 50\n- N is an integer.\n- Each S_i is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 50, inclusive.\n- If i \\neq j, the length of S_i is different from the length of S_j.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nS_1\r\nS_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nS_N\r\nOutput\nPrint the answer.",
