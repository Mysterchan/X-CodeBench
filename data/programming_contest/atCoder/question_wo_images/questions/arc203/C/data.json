    "Problem Statement": "Rooms are arranged in a grid with H rows and W columns.\nThere are walls between adjacent rooms that share an edge.\nWhen you are in room A and room B is adjacent to room A in one of the four directions (up, down, left, right), and the wall between room A and room B has been demolished, you can move from room A to room B.\nFind the total number, modulo 998244353, of ways to choose K walls such that the following condition is satisfied.\n- When all chosen walls are demolished, it is possible to move from the top-left room to the bottom-right room by passing through some rooms.\nSolve T test cases for each input file.",

    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 \\times 10^5\n- 2 ≤ H ≤ 2 \\times 10^5\n- 2 ≤ W ≤ 2 \\times 10^5\n- \\boldsymbol{0 ≤ K ≤ H+W}\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nT\ncase_1\ncase_2\n\\vdots\ncase_T\nEach case is given in the following format:\nH W K\nOutput\nOutput the answers in a total of T lines.\nThe t-th line should contain the total number, modulo 998244353, of ways to select K walls that satisfy the condition for the t-th test case.",

            "explanation": "In the first case, demolishing any single wall does not allow movement from the top-left room to the bottom-right room.\nIn the second case, choosing and demolishing any three walls out of the four available walls allows movement from the top-left room to the bottom-right room.",
