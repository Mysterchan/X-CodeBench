    "Problem Statement": "There is an integer sequence A=(A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_N) of length N consisting of 0 and 1.\nYou are given Q queries.\nThe q-th query is as follows:\n- An integer i_q between 1 and N is given. Change A_{i_q} to 1 if it is 0, and to 0 if it is 1.\nAfter processing each query, find the answer to the following problem:\nConsider sequences B=(B_1,B_2,\\dots,B_{|B|}) consisting of 0 and 1 that satisfy the following condition:\n- By performing the following operation any number of times on B, it can be made to match sequence A: \n- Choose an integer i between 1 and |B|-1, inclusive.\n- Insert B_i\\oplus B_{i+1} between B_i and B_{i+1}.  \nIt can be proved that there always exists a B that satisfies the condition.\nFind the minimum possible value of |B|.",
