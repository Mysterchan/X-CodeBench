    "Problem Statement": "You are given length-N integer sequences A=(A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_N) and B=(B_1,B_2,\\dots,B_N), each consisting of 0 and 1.\nLet A[i,j] denote the consecutive subsequence of A from the i-th through the j-th element. If i>j, then A[i,j] is a length-0 sequence.\nYou can perform the following operation on A any number of times:\n- Choose four integers a,b,c,d that satisfy the following two conditions: \n- 1 ≤ a ≤ b < c ≤ d ≤ N \n- \\sum_{i=a}^{b}{A_i}=\\sum_{i=c}^{d}{A_i} \n \n- Swap A[a,b] and A[c,d]. More precisely, replace A with the sequence formed by concatenating A[1,a-1], A[c,d], A[b+1,c-1], A[a,b], A[d+1,N] in this order. \nDetermine whether A can be made to match B.\nSolve T test cases for each input file.",

            "explanation": "In the first test case, A is initially (1,1,1,0,0,1).\r\nBy choosing (a,b,c,d)=(1,2,3,6) and performing the operation, A becomes (1,0,0,1,1,1).\r\nNext, by choosing (a,b,c,d)=(1,2,3,4) and performing the operation, A becomes (0,1,1,0,1,1), which matches B.\r\nIn the second test case, A cannot be made to match B.\r\nIn the third test case, A already matches B from the beginning.",
