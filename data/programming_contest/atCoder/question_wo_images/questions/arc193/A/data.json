    "Problem Statement": "For integers l, r, let [l, r] denote the set of all integers from l through r. That is, [l, r] = \\lbrace l, l+1, l+2, ..., r-1, r\\rbrace.\nYou are given N pairs of integers (L_1, R_1), (L_2, R_2), ..., (L_N, R_N).\nBased on these pairs, consider an undirected graph G defined as follows:\n- It has N vertices numbered 1, 2, ..., N.\n- For all i, j \\in [1, N], there is an undirected edge between vertices i and j if and only if the intersection of [L_i, R_i] and [L_j, R_j] is empty.\nIn addition, for each i = 1, 2, ..., N, define the weight of vertex i to be W_i.\nYou are given Q queries about G. Process these queries in the order they are given.\nFor each i = 1, 2, ..., Q, the i-th query is the following:\nYou are given integers s_i and t_i (both between 1 and N, inclusive) such that s_i \\neq t_i. Determine whether there exists a path from vertex s_i to vertex t_i in G. If it exists, print the minimum possible weight of such a path.\nHere, the weight of a path from vertex s to vertex t is defined as the sum of the weights of the vertices on that path (including both endpoints s and t).",

The weight of this path is W_1 + W_3 + W_4 = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11, and this is the minimum possible.\n- For the second query, there is a path from vertex 4 to vertex 3 given by 4 \\to 3. The weight of this path is W_4 + W_3 = 2 + 4 = 6, and this is the minimum possible.\n- For the third query, there is no path from vertex 5 to vertex 2. Hence, print -1.",
