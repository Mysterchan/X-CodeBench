    "Problem Statement": "You are given a positive integer N and a length-N string s_0s_1... s_{N-1} consisting only of 0 and 1.\nConsider a simple undirected graph G with (N+1) vertices numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., N, and the following edges:\n- For each i = 0, 1, ..., N-1, there is an undirected edge between vertices i and (i+1)\\bmod N.\n- For each i = 0, 1, ..., N-1, there is an undirected edge between vertices i and N if and only if s_i = 1.\n- There are no other edges.\nFurthermore, create a directed graph G' by assigning a direction to each edge of G. That is, for each undirected edge \\lbrace u, v \\rbrace in G, replace it with either a directed edge (u, v) from u to v or a directed edge (v, u) from v to u.\nFor each i = 0, 1, ..., N, let d_i be the in-degree of vertex i in G'. Print the number, modulo 998244353, of distinct sequences (d_0, d_1, ..., d_N) that can be obtained.",
