    "Problem Statement": "You are given an integer sequence A=(A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4,A_5) obtained by permuting (1,2,3,4,5).\nDetermine whether A can be sorted in ascending order by performing exactly one operation of swapping two adjacent elements in A.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- A is an integer sequence of length 5 obtained by permuting (1,2,3,4,5).",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5\r\nOutput\nIf A can be sorted in ascending order by exactly one operation, print Yes; otherwise, print No.",

            "output": "Yes\n",
            "explanation": "By swapping A_3 and A_4, A becomes (1,2,3,4,5), so it can be sorted in ascending order. Therefore, print Yes.",
