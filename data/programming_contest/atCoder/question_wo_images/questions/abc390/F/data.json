    "Problem Statement": "You are given an integer sequence A=(A_1,A_2,...,A_N) of length N.\nFor each integer pair (L,R) with 1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N, define f(L,R) as follows:\n- Start with an empty blackboard. Write the R-L+1 integers A_L, A_{L+1}, ..., A_R on the blackboard in order.\n- Repeat the following operation until all integers on the blackboard are erased:\n- Choose integers l, r with l ≤ r such that every integer from l through r appears at least once on the blackboard. Then, erase all integers from l through r that are on the blackboard.\n- Let f(L,R) be the minimum number of such operations needed to erase all the integers from the blackboard.\nFind \\displaystyle \\sum_{L=1}^N \\sum_{R=L}^N f(L,R).",

            "explanation": "For example, in the case of (L,R)=(1,4):\n\n- The blackboard has 1,3,1,4.\n- Choose (l,r)=(1,1) and erase all occurrences of 1. The blackboard now has 3,4.\n- Choose (l,r)=(3,4) and erase all occurrences of 3 and 4. The blackboard becomes empty.\n- It cannot be done in fewer than two operations, so f(1,4) = 2.\n\n\nSimilarly, you can find f(2,4)=2, f(1,1)=1, etc.\n\n\\displaystyle \\sum_{L=1}^N \\sum_{R=L}^N f(L,R) = 16, so print 16.",
