    "Problem Statement": "There are N bags, labeled bag 1, bag 2, ..., bag N.\nBag i (1 ≤ i ≤ N) contains A_i stones.\nTakahashi can perform the following operation any number of times, possibly zero:\nChoose two bags A and B, and move all stones from bag A into bag B.\nFind the number of different possible values for the following after repeating the operation.\n- B_1 \\oplus B_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus B_N, where B_i is the final number of stones in bag i.\nHere, \\oplus denotes bitwise XOR.\nAbout bitwise XOR\nFor non-negative integers a and b, the bitwise XOR a \\oplus b is defined as follows:\n\n\nIn the binary representation of a \\oplus b, the digit in the 2^k place (k ≥ 0) is 1 if and only if exactly one of the digits in the 2^k place of a and b is 1; otherwise, it is 0.\n\n\nFor example, 3 \\oplus 5 = 6 (in binary, 011 \\oplus 101 = 110).\nIn general, for k non-negative integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_k, their bitwise XOR x_1 \\oplus x_2 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus x_k is defined as (\\cdots((x_1 \\oplus x_2) \\oplus x_3) \\oplus \\cdots) \\oplus x_k, which does not depend on the order of x_1, x_2, ..., x_k.\nIt can be proved that under the constraints of this problem, the number of possible values is finite.",
