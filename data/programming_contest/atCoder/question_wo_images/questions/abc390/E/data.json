    "Problem Statement": "There are N foods, each containing exactly one of vitamins 1, 2, and 3.\nSpecifically, eating the i-th food gives you A_i units of vitamin V_i, and C_i calories.\nTakahashi can choose any subset of these N foods as long as the total calorie consumption does not exceed X.\nFind the maximum possible value of this: the minimum intake among vitamins 1, 2, and 3.",

    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ N ≤ 5000\n- 1 ≤ X ≤ 5000\n- 1 ≤ V_i ≤ 3\n- 1 ≤ A_i ≤ 2 \\times 10^5\n- 1 ≤ C_i ≤ X\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X\nV_1 A_1 C_1\nV_2 A_2 C_2\n\\vdots\nV_N A_N C_N\nOutput\nPrint the maximum possible value of \"the minimum intake among vitamins 1, 2, and 3\" when the total calories consumed is at most X.",

            "explanation": "Each food provides the following if eaten:\n\n- 1st food: 8 units of vitamin 1, and 5 calories\n- 2nd food: 3 units of vitamin 2, and 5 calories\n- 3rd food: 7 units of vitamin 2, and 10 calories\n- 4th food: 2 units of vitamin 3, and 5 calories\n- 5th food: 3 units of vitamin 3, and 10 calories\n\n\nEating the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th foods gives 8 units of vitamin 1, 3 units of vitamin 2, 5 units of vitamin 3, and 25 calories.\nIn this case, the minimum among the three vitamin intakes is 3 (vitamin 2).\n\nIt is impossible to get 4 or more units of each vitamin without exceeding 25 calories, so the answer is 3.",
