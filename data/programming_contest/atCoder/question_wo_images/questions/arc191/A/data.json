    "Problem Statement": "You are given a string S of length N and a string T of length M, both consisting of digits from 1 to 9.\nYou will perform the following operation for k=1,2,...,M in order:\n- Choose an integer i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ N. Then, replace the i-th character of S with the k-th character of T.\nFind the maximum possible value of the resulting string S interpreted as an integer after performing the M operations.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ N,M ≤ 10^6\n- N and M are integers.\n- S is a string of length N consisting of digits from 1 through 9.\n- T is a string of length M consisting of digits from 1 through 9.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nS\nT\nOutput\nPrint the maximum possible value of the resulting string S interpreted as an integer after performing the M operations.",

            "explanation": "The following sequence of operations is optimal:\n\n- For k=1: Choose i=3. Then, S = 193.\n- For k=2: Choose i=1. Then, S = 293.\n- For k=3: Choose i=1. Then, S = 593.\n\n\nIn this case, the value of S interpreted as an integer is 593, which is the maximum.",
