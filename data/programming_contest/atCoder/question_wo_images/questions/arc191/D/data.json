    "Problem Statement": "You are given a simple connected undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, where the vertices are numbered 1 to N and the edges are numbered 1 to M. Edge i connects vertex u_i and vertex v_i in both directions.\nInitially, there is a piece A on vertex S and a piece B on vertex T. Here, S and T are given as input.\nYou may perform the following operation any number of times in any order:\n- Choose either piece A or piece B, and move it from its current vertex to an adjacent vertex via an edge. However, you cannot make a move that results in both pieces ending up on the same vertex.\nYour goal is to reach the state in which piece A is on vertex T and piece B is on vertex S.\nDetermine whether this is possible, and if it is, find the minimum number of operations required to achieve it.",

    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M S T\nu_1 v_1\nu_2 v_2\n\\vdots\nu_M v_M\nOutput\nIf it is impossible to achieve the goal, print -1.\nIf it is possible, print the minimum number of operations required.",

            "explanation": "For example, the following sequence of operations completes the goal in three moves:\n\n- Move piece A to vertex 2.\n- Piece A is on vertex 2, piece B is on vertex 4.\n\n\n- Move piece B to vertex 3.\n- Piece A is on vertex 2, piece B is on vertex 3.\n\n\n- Move piece A to vertex 4.\n- Piece A is on vertex 4, piece B is on vertex 3.\n\n\n\n\nIt is impossible to complete the goal in fewer than three moves, so print 3.",
