    "Problem Statement": "You are given two positive integers N and K. A positive integer X is called compatible with N if it satisfies the following condition:\n- The bitwise XOR of X and N is equal to the remainder when X is divided by N.\nDetermine whether there exist at least K such integers X that are compatible with N. If they do exist, find the K-th smallest such integer.\nYou are given T test cases; solve each of them.\n About XOR\n \n The bitwise XOR of nonnegative integers A and B, denoted A\\ \\mathrm{XOR}\\ B, is defined as follows:\n \n- In the binary representation of A\\ \\mathrm{XOR}\\ B, the digit in the 2^k place (for k ≥ 0) is 1 if and only if exactly one of A and B has a 1 in the 2^k place in its binary representation. Otherwise, it is 0.\n For example, 3\\ \\mathrm{XOR}\\ 5 = 6 (in binary: 011\\ \\mathrm{XOR}\\ 101 = 110).",

            "explanation": "Consider the case N=2.\n\n- When X=1, X\\ \\mathrm{XOR}\\ N = 3 and the remainder of X when divided by N is 1. Therefore, 1 is not compatible with N.\n- When X=2, X\\ \\mathrm{XOR}\\ N = 0 and the remainder of X when divided by N is 0. Therefore, 2 is compatible with N.\n- When X=3, X\\ \\mathrm{XOR}\\ N = 1 and the remainder of X when divided by N is 1. Therefore, 3 is compatible with N.\n\n\nHence, among the numbers that are compatible with 2, the smallest is 2 and the second smallest is 3. Therefore, the answer to \\text{case}_1 is 2 and the answer to \\text{case}_2 is 3.",
