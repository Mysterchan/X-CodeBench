    "Problem Statement": "Overview: Create an N \\times N pattern as follows.\n###########\n#.........#\n#.#######.#\n#.#.....#.#\n#.#.###.#.#\n#.#.#.#.#.#\n#.#.###.#.#\n#.#.....#.#\n#.#######.#\n#.........#\n###########\nYou are given a positive integer N.\nConsider an N \\times N grid. Let (i,j) denote the cell at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left. Initially, no cell is colored.\nThen, for i = 1,2,\\dots,N in order, perform the following operation:\n- Let j = N + 1 - i.\n- If i ≤ j, fill the rectangular region whose top-left cell is (i,i) and bottom-right cell is (j,j) with black if i is odd, or white if i is even. If some cells are already colored, overwrite their colors. \n- If i > j, do nothing.\nAfter all these operations, it can be proved that there are no uncolored cells. Determine the final color of each cell.",
