    "Problem Statement": "You are given integers W,H,L,R,D,U.\nA town of Kyoto is on the two-dimensional plane.\nIn the town, there is exactly one block at each lattice point (x,y) that satisfies all of the following conditions. There are no blocks at any other points.\n- 0≤ x≤ W\n- 0≤ y≤ H\n- x<L or R<x or y<D or U<y\nSnuke traveled through the town as follows.\n- First, he chooses one block and stands there.\n- Then, he performs the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n- Move one unit in the positive direction of the x-axis or the positive direction of the y-axis. However, the point after moving must also have a block.\nPrint the number, modulo 998244353, of possible paths that Snuke could have taken.",
