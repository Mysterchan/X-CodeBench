    "Problem Statement": "There is a grid with N rows and N columns. Let (r,c) denote the cell at the r-th row from the top and c-th column from the left. Each cell is colored black or white. Cell (r,c) is colored black when S_{r,c} is #, and white when S_{r,c} is ..\nYou are given Q questions about this grid, so answer each of them. In the i-th question (1≤ i≤ Q), integers U_i,D_i,L_i,R_i are given, so find the answer to the following question.\n- After coloring all cells that do not satisfy U_i ≤ r ≤ D_i and L_i ≤ c ≤ R_i black, find the maximum number of times you can perform the following operation.\n- Choose a pair of integers (r,c) such that cells (r,c),(r,c+1),(r+1,c),(r+1,c+1) are all colored white, and color one of these four cells black.\nSolve each question independently. In other words, the color of each cell is reset to the initial state for each question.",

Among cells (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2), choose cell (1,2) and color it black.\n- Choose (r,c)=(2,2). Among cells (2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3), choose cell (2,2) and color it black.\n\n\nYou cannot perform the operation more than twice, so output 2 on the first line.",
