    "Problem Statement": "There is a complete graph with N vertices numbered 1 to N. Each edge is colored black or white. For i=1,2,...,M, the edge connecting vertices U_i and V_i is colored black, and all other edges are colored white.\nYou can perform the following operation zero or more times.\n- Choose a triple of integers (a,b,c) satisfying 1≤ a < b < c ≤ N, and repaint each of the following three edges: white to black, black to white.\n- The edge connecting vertices a and b\n- The edge connecting vertices b and c\n- The edge connecting vertices a and c\nFind the maximum number of edges that can be colored black when you perform operations appropriately.",

Then, we have the following four black edges.\n- The edge connecting vertices 1 and 2\n- The edge connecting vertices 1 and 3\n- The edge connecting vertices 1 and 4\n- The edge connecting vertices 3 and 4\n\n\n- Choose (a,b,c)=(2,3,4). Then, we have the following five black edges.\n- The edge connecting vertices 1 and 2\n- The edge connecting vertices 1 and 3\n- The edge connecting vertices 1 and 4\n- The edge connecting vertices 2 and 3\n- The edge connecting vertices 2 and 4\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot make the number of black edges more than 5, so output 5.",
