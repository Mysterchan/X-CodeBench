    "Problem Statement": "You are given a length-N sequence of non-negative integers A=(A_1,A_2,...,A_N).\nFor k=1,2,...,N, solve the following problem.\n- Find the product, modulo 998244353, of A_i for all integers i between 1 and k, inclusive, such that the bitwise \\mathrm{OR} operation of A_i and A_k equals A_k.\n What is bitwise \\mathrm{OR} operation?\n \n The bitwise \\mathrm{OR} of non-negative integers X and Y, denoted X\\ \\mathrm{OR}\\ Y, is defined as follows.\n \n- When X\\ \\mathrm{OR}\\ Y is written in binary, the digit at the 2^k (k ≥ 0) place is 1 if at least one of the digits at the 2^k place when X and Y are written in binary is 1, and 0 otherwise.\n For example, 3\\ \\mathrm{OR}\\ 5 = 7 (in binary: 011\\ \\mathrm{OR}\\ 101 = 111).",

Therefore, the answer for the case k=1 is A_1=1.\n- When k=2: For i=1,2, the bitwise \\mathrm{OR} operation of A_i and A_k is 3,2, respectively. Therefore, the answer for the case k=2 is A_2=2.\n- When k=3: For i=1,2,3, the bitwise \\mathrm{OR} operation of A_i and A_k is all 3. Therefore, the answer for the case k=3 is A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3=6.\n- When k=4: For i=1,2,3,4, the bitwise \\mathrm{OR} operation of A_i and A_k is 5,7,7,5, respectively. Therefore, the answer for the case k=4 is A_1\\times A_4=5.",
