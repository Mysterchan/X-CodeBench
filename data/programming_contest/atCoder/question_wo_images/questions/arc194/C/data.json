    "Problem Statement": "You are given two integer sequences of length N, A = (A_1, A_2, ..., A_N) and B = (B_1, B_2, ..., B_N), each consisting of 0 and 1.\nYou can perform the following operation on A any number of times (possibly zero):\n- First, choose an integer i satisfying 1 ≤ i ≤ N, and flip the value of A_i (if the original value is 0, change it to 1; if it is 1, change it to 0).\n- Then, pay \\sum_{k=1}^N A_k C_k yen as the cost of this operation.\nNote that the cost calculation in step 2 uses the A after the change in step 1.\nPrint the minimum total cost required to make A identical to B.",

            "explanation": "Consider the following procedure:\n\n- First, flip A_4. Now, A = (0, 1, 1, 0). The cost of this operation is 0 \\times 4 + 1 \\times 6 + 1 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 9 = 8 yen.\n- Next, flip A_2. Now, A = (0, 0, 1, 0). The cost of this operation is 0 \\times 4 + 0 \\times 6 + 1 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 9 = 2 yen.\n- Finally, flip A_1. Now, A = (1, 0, 1, 0), which matches B. The cost of this operation is 1 \\times 4 + 0 \\times 6 + 1 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 9 = 6 yen.\n\n\nIn this case, the total cost is 8 + 2 + 6 = 16 yen, which is the minimum possible.",
