    "Problem Statement": "You are given an integer sequence of length N: (A_1, A_2, ..., A_N). There is also a sequence S, which is initially empty.\nFor each i = 1, 2, ..., N in this order, you perform exactly one of the following two operations:\n- Append A_i as an element to the end of S.\n- Delete the last element of S. You cannot choose this operation if S is empty.\nPrint the maximum possible value of the sum of the elements of S after all operations.",

            "explanation": "Starting from the initial state where S is an empty sequence, consider the following operations:\n\n- For i = 1, append A_1 = 3 to the end of S. Now, S = (3).\n- For i = 2, append A_2 = -1 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, -1).\n- For i = 3, delete the last element of S. Now, S = (3).\n- For i = 4, append A_4 = 5 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, 5).\n- For i = 5, append A_5 = -9 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, 5, -9).\n- For i = 6, delete the last element of S. Now, S = (3, 5).\n\n\nHere, the sum of the elements of S after all operations is 3 + 5 = 8, which is the maximum possible value.",
