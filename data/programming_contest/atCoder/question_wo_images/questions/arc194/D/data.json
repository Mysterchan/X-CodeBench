    "Problem Statement": "A string is defined to be a valid parenthesis sequence if and only if it satisfies one of the following conditions:\n- It is an empty string.\n- There exists a valid parenthesis sequence A such that the string is obtained by concatenating (, A, and ) in this order.\n- There exist non-empty valid parenthesis sequences A and B such that the string is obtained by concatenating A and B in this order.\nYou are given a valid parenthesis sequence S of length N. You can perform the following operation any number of times:\n- Choose a contiguous substring of S that is a valid parenthesis sequence, and reverse it.\nHere, reversing the substring of S from the l-th character to the r-th character means the following:\n- For every integer i satisfying l ≤ i ≤ r, simultaneously replace S_i with ) if S_{l+r-i} is (, and with ( if S_{l+r-i} is ).(Note that reversing here is different from the usual definition of reversing.)\nFind the number, modulo 998244353, of distinct strings S that you can have at the end of the process.",

            "explanation": "For example, you can transform S into ()(()) by doing the following:\n\n- Choose the substring from the 1st to the 6th character of S. This is a valid parenthesis sequence. S becomes ()(()).\n\n\nThe only other string that can be formed is (())(). Thus, the answer is 2.",
