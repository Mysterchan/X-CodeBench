    "Problem Statement": "You are given two strings S and T, each of length N and consisting of 0 and 1, as well as two positive integers X and Y. For i = 1, 2, ..., N, let S_i denote the i-th character of S.\nDetermine whether it is possible to make S identical to T by repeatedly performing Operations A and B below any number of times (possibly zero) in any order:\n- \n(Operation A) Choose an integer i satisfying 1 ≤ i ≤ N-(X+Y)+1, S_{i} = S_{i+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+X-1} = 0, and S_{i+X} = S_{i+X+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+X+Y-1} = 1, then change each of S_{i}, S_{i+1}, ..., S_{i+Y-1} to 1 and each of S_{i+Y}, S_{i+Y+1}, ..., S_{i+Y+X-1} to 0.\n- \n(Operation B) Choose an integer i satisfying 1 ≤ i ≤ N-(X+Y)+1, S_{i} = S_{i+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+Y-1} = 1, and S_{i+Y} = S_{i+Y+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+Y+X-1} = 0, then change each of S_{i}, S_{i+1}, ..., S_{i+X-1} to 0 and each of S_{i+X}, S_{i+X+1}, ..., S_{i+X+Y-1} to 1.",
