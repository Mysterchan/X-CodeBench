    "Problem Statement": "You are given a permutation P = (P_1, P_2, ..., P_N) of (1, 2, ..., N). Takahashi can repeatedly perform the following operation on P (possibly zero times):\n- Choose an integer i satisfying 1 ≤ i ≤ N-1. Pay a cost of i, and swap P_i and P_{i+1}.\nFind the minimum total cost required to sort P in ascending order.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 2 ≤ N ≤ 2 \\times 10^5\n- (P_1, P_2, ..., P_N) is a permutation of (1, 2, ..., N).\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nP_1 P_2 ... P_N\nOutput\nPrint the minimum total cost required to sort P in ascending order.",

Now, P = (2, 1, 3).\n- Pay a cost of 1 and swap P_1 = 2 and P_2 = 1. Now, P = (1, 2, 3).\n\n\nThe total cost for these operations is 4, which is the minimum possible.",
