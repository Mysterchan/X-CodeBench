    "Problem Statement": "There is an empty array A. For i = 1,2,...,N, perform the following operation in order:\n- Insert the number i into A so that it becomes the P_i-th element from the beginning.\n- More precisely, replace A with the concatenation of the first P_i-1 elements of A, then i, then the remaining elements of A starting from the P_i-th element, in this order.\nOutput the final array A after all operations have been completed.",

    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ N ≤ 5\\times 10^5\n- 1 ≤ P_i ≤ i\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nP_1 P_2 ... P_N\r\nOutput\nLet the final array be A = (A_1, A_2, ..., A_N).\r\nPrint A_1, A_2, ..., A_N in this order, separated by spaces.",

            "explanation": "The operations are performed as follows:\n\n- Insert the number 1 so that it becomes the 1st element of A. Now, A = (1).\n- Insert the number 2 so that it becomes the 1st element of A. Now, A = (2, 1).\n- Insert the number 3 so that it becomes the 2nd element of A. Now, A = (2, 3, 1).\n- Insert the number 4 so that it becomes the 1st element of A. Now, A = (4, 2, 3, 1).",
