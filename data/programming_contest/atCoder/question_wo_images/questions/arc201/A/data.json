    "Problem Statement": "The problem setting of this problem is partially shared with Problem F.\nIn the year 2222, CatCoder will hold the CatCoder Double Contest (abbreviated as C2C).\nThere are N writers who have problem proposals.\nEach writer's problem proposals are classified into 3 types by difficulty: Hard, Medium, Easy, and the i-th writer has A_i, B_i, C_i problem proposals of Hard, Medium, Easy, respectively.\nEach C2C simultaneously holds 2 divisions, Div.1 and Div.2. The problem proposals required for each division are as follows:\n- Div.1: One Hard and one Medium problem proposal from the same writer\n- Div.2: One Medium and one Easy problem proposal from the same writer\nNote that the writers for Div.1 and Div.2 do not necessarily have to be the same.\nAlso, each problem proposal can be used in at most one division of one C2C.\nFind the maximum number of times C2C can be held.\nT test cases are given, so find the answer for each.",
