    "Problem Statement": "You are given a sequence A=(A_1,...,A_N) of length N. You perform the following operation exactly once.\n- Choose a pair of integers (L,R) such that 1≤ L ≤ R ≤ N. Replace each of A_L,A_{L+1},...,A_R with A_L.\nHow many different sequences are possible as A after the operation?",
