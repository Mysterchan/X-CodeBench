    "Problem Statement": "N slimes are arranged in a line. The size of the i-th slime from the left is P_i, and its color is C_i. Here, the sizes of the slimes are distinct.\nA sequence of slimes is called a good sequence when it satisfies the following condition:\n- By repeatedly performing the operation of swapping the positions of two adjacent slimes of different colors, it is possible to arrange the slimes in ascending order of size.\nTo make the sequence of slimes a good sequence, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n- Choose a slime, and change the color of the slime to any integer between 1 and N, inclusive. This operation costs x, where x is the color of the slime immediately before this operation.\nFind the minimum total cost required to make the sequence of slimes a good sequence.",

    "Constraints": "- All input values are integers.\n- 1 ≤ N ≤ 2\\times 10^5\n- 1≤ P_i ≤ N\n- 1≤ C_i ≤ N\n- P is a permutation of (1,...,N).",

Then, by swapping the 1-st and 2-nd slimes, and swapping the 2-nd and 3-rd slimes, it is possible to arrange the slimes in ascending order of size, making it a good sequence.\n\nThe required cost is 1, since the color of the 3-rd slime immediately before the operation was 1.",
