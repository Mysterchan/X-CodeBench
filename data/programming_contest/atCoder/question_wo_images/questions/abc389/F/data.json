    "Problem Statement": "Takahashi plans to participate in N AtCoder contests.\nIn the i-th contest (1 ≤ i ≤ N), if his rating is between L_i and R_i (inclusive), his rating increases by 1.\nYou are given Q queries in the following format:\n- An integer X is given. Assuming that Takahashi's initial rating is X, determine his rating after participating in all N contests.",
