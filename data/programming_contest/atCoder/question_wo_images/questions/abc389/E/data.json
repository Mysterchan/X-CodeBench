    "Problem Statement": "There are N types of products, each having 10^{100} units in stock.\nYou can buy any non-negative number of units of each product. To buy k units of the i-th product, it costs k^2 P_i yen.\nIf your total purchase cost is at most M yen, what is the maximum number of units you can buy in total?",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 \\times 10^{5}\n- 1 ≤ M ≤ 10^{18}\n- 1 ≤ P_i ≤ 2 \\times 10^{9}\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\r\nP_1 ... P_N\r\nOutput\nPrint the answer.",

            "input": "3 9\n4 1 9\n",
            "output": "3\n",
            "explanation": "If you buy one unit of the 1st product and two units of the 2nd product, the total purchase cost is 1^2 \\times 4 + 2^2 \\times 1 = 8. It is impossible to buy four or more units in total with a total cost of at most 9 yen, so the answer is 3.",
