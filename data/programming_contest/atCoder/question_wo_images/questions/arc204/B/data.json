    "Problem Statement": "You are given positive integers N, K and a permutation P = (P_{1}, P_{2}, \\dots, P_{NK}) of (1, 2, \\dots, NK).\nAlice repeatedly performs the following operation to sort P in ascending order.\n- Choose integers i and j (i\\neq j) where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ NK, and swap P_{i} and P_{j}. If |i - j| is a multiple of N, Alice gets 1 point.\nAlice sorts P in ascending order with the minimum number of operations, and under that condition, she maximizes the sum of points she gets.\nOutput the sum of points Alice gets.",

            "explanation": "For example, P can be sorted in ascending order with four operations as follows.\n\n- Perform the operation with (i, j) = (2, 5). After the operation, P = (1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4).\n- Perform the operation with (i, j) = (4, 6). After the operation, P = (1, 2, 5, 4, 6, 3).\n- Perform the operation with (i, j) = (3, 5). After the operation, P = (1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 3).\n- Perform the operation with (i, j) = (3, 6). After the operation, P = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n\n\nAmong the above four operations, Alice gets 1 point from each of the 1st and 4th operations, so Alice gets a total of 2 points.\n\nThis sequence of operations is one of the ways to sort P in ascending order with the minimum number of operations and maximize the sum of points under that condition, so output 2.",
