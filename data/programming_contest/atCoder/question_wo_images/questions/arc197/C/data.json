    "Problem Statement": "Let S be the set of all positive integers.\nProcess Q queries in order. The i-th query gives you an integer A_i not less than 2 and a positive integer B_i, so perform the following two steps in order.\n- Remove from S all elements that are multiples of A_i.\n- Print the B_i-th smallest element of S. It can be shown that under the given constraints, S contains at least B_i elements at this point.",

    "Constraints": "- 1≤ Q≤ 10^5\n- 2≤ A_i≤ 10^9\n- 1≤ B_i≤ 10^5\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nQ\nA_1 B_1\n\\vdots\nA_Q B_Q\nOutput\nPrint Q lines. The i-th line should contain the B_i-th smallest element of S after removing all multiples of A_i from S.",

            "explanation": "When the elements of S are listed in ascending order, the beginning of the list evolves as follows.\n\n- Initially, S=\\lbrace 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...\\rbrace.\n- The first query removes multiples of 5, resulting in S=\\lbrace1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,...\\rbrace.\n- The second query removes multiples of 6, resulting in S=\\lbrace1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,13,14,...\\rbrace.\n- The third query removes multiples of 6, resulting in S=\\lbrace1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,13,14,...\\rbrace.\n- The fourth query removes multiples of 9, resulting in S=\\lbrace1,2,3,4,7,8,11,13,14,16,...\\rbrace.\n- The fifth query removes multiples of 123456789, resulting in S=\\lbrace1,2,3,4,7,8,11,13,14,16,...\\rbrace.",
