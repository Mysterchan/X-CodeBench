    "Problem Statement": "Define the score of a non-empty integer sequence x = (x_1, ..., x_n) as the number of elements of x that are strictly greater than the average of x.\nThat is, the score of x is the count of indices i satisfying x_i > \\dfrac{x_1+\\cdots+x_n}{n}.\nYou are given a length-N integer sequence A = (A_1, ..., A_N). Find the maximum score of a non-empty subsequence of A.\nThere are T test cases; solve each one.\nDefinition of subsequence\nA subsequence of A is any sequence obtained by deleting zero or more elements from A and keeping the remaining elements in their original order.",
