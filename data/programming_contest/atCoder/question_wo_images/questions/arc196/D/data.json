    "Problem Statement": "There are N towns, numbered 1,2,...,N, arranged in a line in this order.\nThere are N-1 roads connecting adjacent towns: road j\\,(1 ≤ j ≤ N-1) connects towns j and j+1. For each road j, you can set a strength w_j (an integer that may be negative).\nWhen a person travels along a road, their stamina changes. Specifically, if a person with stamina x travels along road j, their stamina becomes x + w_j.\nThere are M people who will now move between these towns.\nPerson i\\,(1 ≤ i ≤ M) starts with stamina 0 at town S_i and travels to town T_i via the shortest path.\nIt is guaranteed that |S_i - T_i| > 1. Also, (S_i, T_i) \\neq (S_j, T_j) if i \\neq j.\nPerson i’s requirement is as follows:\nWhen departing Town S_i and when arriving at Town T_i, their stamina should be exactly 0. At every other town, their stamina should always be a positive integer.\nAssume that there are no changes to stamina other than those due to traveling along roads as described above.\nProcess Q queries. For the k-th query (1 ≤ k ≤ Q), if it is possible to set the strengths of the roads so that the requirements of all people L_k, L_k + 1, ..., R_k are satisfied, print Yes; otherwise, print No.",
