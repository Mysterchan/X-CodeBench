    "Problem Statement": "You are given a length-N sequence A = (A_1, ..., A_N) of non-negative integers. Answer Q queries.\nIn the i-th query, you are given integers L_i and R_i such that 1 ≤ L_i ≤ R_i ≤ N. Solve the following problem for the subsequence B = (A_{L_i}, ..., A_{R_i}) of length R_i - L_i + 1.\nWe repeat the following operation on B:\n- Choose integers i and j with 1 ≤ i, j ≤ |B| such that B_i ≥ 1, B_j ≥ 1, and 1 ≤ j - i ≤ 2. Subtract 1 from B_i and B_j.\nFind the maximum number of times the operation can be performed.",

Then B = (0,1,3,0,3,2).\n- Choose i=2 and j=3. Then B = (0,0,2,0,3,2).\n- Choose i=3 and j=5. Then B = (0,0,1,0,2,2).\n- Choose i=5 and j=6. Then B = (0,0,1,0,1,1).\n- Choose i=5 and j=6.
