    "Problem Statement": "You are given an undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, where the vertices are numbered 1 through N and the edges are numbered 1 through M. Edge i connects vertices u_i and v_i.\nTo make the graph simple by removing edges, what is the minimum number of edges that must be removed?\nHere, a graph is called simple if and only if it does not contain self-loops or multi-edges.",
    "Statement Images": [],
    "Constraints": "- 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 \\times 10^5\n- 0 ≤ M ≤ 5 \\times 10^5\n- 1 ≤ u_i ≤ N\n- 1 ≤ v_i ≤ N\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\r\nu_1 v_1\r\nu_2 v_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nu_M v_M\r\nOutput\nPrint the minimum number of edges that must be removed to make the graph simple.",

            "explanation": "By removing edges 3 and 5, the graph becomes simple. This is one of the ways to remove the minimum number of edges, so the answer is 2.",
