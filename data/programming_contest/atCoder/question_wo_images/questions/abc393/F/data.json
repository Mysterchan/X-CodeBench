    "Problem Statement": "You are given a sequence A = (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N) of length N.\nAnswer Q queries. The i-th query (1 ≤ i ≤ Q) is as follows:\n- You are given integers R_i and X_i. Consider a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of (A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_{R_i}) that is strictly increasing and consists only of elements at most X_i. Find the maximum possible length of such a subsequence.\nIt is guaranteed that X_i ≥ \\min\\lbrace A_1, A_2,\\dots,A_{R_i} \\rbrace.",
