    "Problem Statement": "You are given a string S of length N consisting of 0 and 1. It is guaranteed that S contains at least one 1.\nYou may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n- Choose an integer i (1 ≤ i ≤ N-1) and swap the i-th and (i+1)-th characters of S.\nFind the minimum number of operations needed so that all 1s are contiguous.\nHere, all 1s are said to be contiguous if and only if there exist integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ N) such that the i-th character of S is 1 if and only if l ≤ i ≤ r, and 0 otherwise.",

    "Constraints": "- 2 ≤ N ≤ 5 \\times 10^5\n- N is an integer.\n- S is a length N string of 0 and 1.\n- S contains at least one 1.",

            "explanation": "For example, the following three operations make all 1s contiguous:\n\n- Choose i=2 and swap the 2nd and 3rd characters. Then, S= 0011001.\n- Choose i=6 and swap the 6th and 7th characters. Then, S= 0011010.\n- Choose i=5 and swap the 5th and 6th characters. Then, S= 0011100.\n\n\nIt is impossible to do this in two or fewer swaps, so the answer is 3.",
