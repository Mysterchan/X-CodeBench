    "Problem Statement": "There are two sequences A=(A_1,\\dots,A_N) and B=(B_1,\\dots,B_N). You can perform the following three types of operations any number of times in any order:\n- Choose an index i such that A_i = -1, and replace A_i with any non-negative integer.\n- Choose an index i such that B_i = -1, and replace B_i with any non-negative integer.\n- Rearrange the elements of sequence A in any order.\nDetermine whether it is possible, after these operations, for all elements of A and B to be non-negative and satisfy A_1 + B_1 = A_2 + B_2 = \\dots = A_N + B_N.",

    "Constraints": "- 2 ≤ N ≤ 2000\n- -1 ≤ A_i ≤ 10^9\n- -1 ≤ B_i ≤ 10^9\n- All input values are integers.",
    "IO Styles": "Input\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 ... A_N\nB_1 B_2 ... B_N\nOutput\nIf it is possible, after the operations, for all elements of A and B to be non-negative and satisfy A_1 + B_1 = A_2 + B_2 = \\dots = A_N + B_N, print Yes. Otherwise, print No.",
