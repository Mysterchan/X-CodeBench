    "title": "Bars not fitting to X-axis ticks in a Seaborn distplot",
    "Description": "The current seaborn distplot shows a histogram with bars for each age from 9 to 17, categorized by fruit type (Strawberry and Banana). However, the ticks on the X-axis do not align correctly with the bars, especially noticeable between ages 11 and 15. The expected output should have the X-axis ticks properly positioned to correspond with the centers of the bars, improving the overall readability of the plot.",
