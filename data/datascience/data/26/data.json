    "title": "How to set space between the axis and the label",
    "Description": "The plot should feature appropriately spaced labels for both the x-axis ('X') and y-axis ('Y'). Currently, the y-axis label 'Y' is touching the y-axis itself, while there is an excessive gap between the x-axis label 'X' and the x-axis. The desired outcome is to have consistent spacing between the axes and their respective labels to improve readability.",
