    "title": "[Bug]: Plot 3d vector",
    "Description": "When plotting a 3D vector at the coordinates [1, 1, -1] with a view angle set by view_init(elev=-45, azim=45), the point does not appear to show correctly in the view. The expectation is that the vector would be visible as a distinct point in the 3D space, but it currently blends into the mesh grid, making it hard to identify.",
