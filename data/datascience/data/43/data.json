    "title": "How do I shift the x-axis over by one to start at 1 instead of 0?",
    "Description": "The plot should display the values starting at position 1 on the x-axis instead of 0. Currently, the x-axis begins at 0, which leads to a misalignment of the plotted points. The expected appearance is for the x-axis range to be adjusted so that the first data point corresponds to x=1, ensuring all plotted values align correctly with their intended x-positions.",
