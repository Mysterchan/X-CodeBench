    "title": "How to draw a broken y-axis catplot graphes with seaborn?",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a Seaborn catplot with violin plots, displaying pulse rates against time, grouped by exercise type (\"kind\"). The two axes should represent a broken y-axis to accommodate different scales: the first axis should range from 0 to 6.5, and the second axis should start from 13.5 and extend upwards. Currently, the graph does not display a broken y-axis, leading to overlapping data representations across the scales, making it difficult to differentiate between the two sets of data. The expected appearance includes a properly segmented y-axis that clearly separates the two scales for clarity in comparison.",
