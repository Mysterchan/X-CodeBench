    "title": "Ticks position in heatmap with categorical data (seaborn)",
    "Description": "The heatmap is intended to display a color-coded matrix with axis labels properly aligned to the centers of the squares. Currently, the y-axis tick labels are positioned too high, and the x-axis tick labels are slightly off to the left. The expected outcome is for both the y-axis and x-axis tick labels to be adjusted so that they are centrally aligned with their respective squares.",
