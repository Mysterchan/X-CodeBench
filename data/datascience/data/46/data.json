    "title": "[Bug]: The Z-axis of 3D figures cannot be visualized properly.",
    "Description": "The 3D surface plot is intended to display the Z-axis vertically, but currently, it appears tilted. Additionally, the Z-axis label is not fully visible in the graph. The plot should ensure the Z-axis is upright and that the Z-axis label is clearly displayed without obstruction.",
