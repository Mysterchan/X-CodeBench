    "title": "Adding a figure created in a function to another figure's subplot",
    "Description": "The intention is to create a single figure with two subplots, each displaying a plot created by custom functions. However, the current implementation results in empty subplots because the figures returned by the functions are not correctly placed into the subplots. The expected outcome is for each subplot to display the respective plots generated by `my_plot_1` and `my_plot_2`.",
