    "title": "How to fill intervals under KDE curve with different colors",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a density plot using Seaborn's `kdeplot`, with colored areas filled under the curve. The area for the interval \\( x < 0 \\) should be filled with one color, and the area for \\( x \\geq 0 \\) should be filled with a different color. The current graph only displays a black line representing the density without any filled areas. The expected graph shows two distinct colored regions beneath the density curve, clearly differentiating the intervals with the respective colors.",
