    "title": "How can I add space between bars in a dodged (hue) group?",
    "Description": "The current histogram generated by the seaborn `histplot` displays bars for Male and Female on the same categories (days). However, the bars are overlapping and lack adequate spacing between them. The intended visualization should separate the Male and Female bars for each day, creating clear space between them while maintaining appropriate sizing, axes labels, and a legend. The expected appearance includes separate, non-overlapping bars for each gender, clearly showing differences in their counts across the specified days.",
