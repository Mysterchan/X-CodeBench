    "title": "[Bug]: twiny in log scale can't set tick_params(top=False)",
    "Description": "When using a secondary x-axis created with `ax.twiny()` in a logarithmic scale, the `tick_params(top=False, labeltop=False)` setting does not function as intended; the top ticks remain visible. The desired behavior is for the top ticks and labels to be disabled while retaining the logarithmic scale for the secondary axis.",
