    "title": "[Bug]: calling title before making polar plot",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a polar plot with theta values ranging from 0 to 6 and corresponding radial values defined by the array r. Currently, the plot displays in a Cartesian coordinate system rather than as a polar plot, which does not represent the data appropriately. The desired outcome is for the plot to correctly visualize the relationship between theta and r in a polar format.",
