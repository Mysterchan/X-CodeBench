    "title": "Seaborn lineplot - connecting dots of scatterplot",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a scatter plot with points connected by a solid line representing the closest joining line among mapped points. In the current graph, the line created by `sns.lineplot` exhibits varying widths at x-axis values that share the same coordinate, leading to an unsatisfactory representation of the connection. The desired outcome is to have a consistent, solid line without fluctuations in width throughout the entire plot.",
