    "title": "Change the colors of Matplotlib's ticklabels based on a condition",
    "Description": "The goal is to modify the y-axis tick labels in the plot so that negative values are displayed in red and positive values are displayed in black. Currently, all y-axis tick labels are displayed in a single color (black), regardless of whether the values are negative or positive. The expected behavior is to visually distinguish the negative values with a red color while keeping the positive values in black.",
