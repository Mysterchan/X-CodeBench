    "title": "How can I plot bar plots with variable widths but without gaps in Python, and add bar width as labels on the x-axis?",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a bar chart displaying categories A through H with corresponding heights specified by the variable `y`, and uniform gaps between the bars. However, the current graph shows uneven gaps between bars, specifically a large gap between bars B and C, and no gap between bars F and G. The desired outcome is to have uniform gap widths or no gaps between all consecutive bars. Additionally, the expected graph includes a legend that identifies the colors associated with each category.",
