    "title": "how to fix the values displayed in a confusion matrix in exponential form to normal form",
    "Description": "The heatmap is intended to display a confusion matrix with the values annotated within each cell. Currently, values of 1102 and 725 are displayed in exponential notation (1.1e+03 and 7.2e+02) instead of their full integer values. The expected result is for the values to appear as 1102 and 725, respectively, within the cells of the heatmap.",
