    "title": "Annotation as symbols on a seaborn heatmap",
    "Description": "The heatmap is intended to display annotations as symbols, specifically using '*' to represent the value 1 and a blank space for the value 0. Currently, the heatmap annotations show the numeric values of 1 and 0 instead of the desired symbols. The expected appearance is a heatmap where the cell corresponding to 1 has a '*' symbol, and the cell corresponding to 0 is blank.",
