    "title": "Have gradient colours in sns.pairplot for one column of dataframe so that I can see which datapoints are connected to each other",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a pairplot showing the interdependence of the DataFrame columns, with a gradual color gradient applied to one column (column 'b'), where low values are represented by yellow and high values by blue. This color gradient should be used on all non-diagonal subplots to enhance the understanding of the data relationships. Currently, the plot does not display this color gradient, as all non-diagonal plots are shown in a uniform light blue color without reflecting the varying values of the chosen column. The expected appearance includes a smooth gradient of color reflecting the numerical values in column 'b' across the relevant subplots.",
