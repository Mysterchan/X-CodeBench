    "title": "Plot stacked barplot with seaborn catplot",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a stacked bar plot using Seaborn's `catplot`, where the `diet` categories are on the x-axis and the `percentage%` values on the y-axis, with the `kind` variable represented as different colors. The current graph displays separate bars for each `kind` within the `diet` categories rather than stacking them. The desired appearance of the graph is to have the bars stacked on top of each other in the `diet` categories, showing the cumulative percentage for each `kind`.",
