    "Description": "The graph is a 3D scatter plot with points defined by x, y, and z coordinates. The x-axis and y-axis are correctly labeled as \"X data\" and \"Y data,\" respectively. However, there is currently no label for the z-axis, which is intended to be labeled as \"Z data.\" The expected behavior is for the z-axis to display a label to provide clarity for the data being represented.",
