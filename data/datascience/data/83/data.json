    "Description": "The intended visualization is a violin plot displaying the distribution of \"total_bill\" across the \"day\" of the week, with data split by \"sex\", and positioned at specified x-axis locations [1, 2, 4, 6]. The current graph displays a violin for \"Fri\" that is too narrow, making it difficult to interpret. The desired outcome is for the \"Fri\" violin to be wider, along with formatted x-axis positions that reflect the specified values.",
