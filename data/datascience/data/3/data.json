    "title": "[Bug]: ax.set_yticklabels(list) skips first item of argument list.",
    "Description": "The y-axis of the plot is missing the label for the first state 'init', resulting in the last label appearing empty. Additionally, there are eight states labeled on the y-axis, but the ax.imshow data contains only seven unique entries. The expected behavior is for all nine states, including 'init', to be displayed correctly on the y-axis.",
