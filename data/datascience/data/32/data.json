    "title": "[Bug]: Zorder issue for lines drawn with ConnectionPatch over inset_axes/plot axes",
    "Description": "The intended visualization is a main plot with inset axes, where `ConnectionPatch` lines are used to connect a zoomed-in section to the originals. Currently, the `ConnectionPatch` lines are drawn above the x-axis labels of both the inset and primary plots, obscuring them despite setting a higher zorder for the axes. The expected outcome is for the connection lines to be displayed below the x-axis labels of the inset axes while remaining visible above the box created by `indicate_zoom_inset` in the main plot area.",
