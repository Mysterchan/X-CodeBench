    "title": "[Bug]: Axis3D not displaying in figure",
    "Description": "In a Jupyter QTConsole session, the intended visualization is a 3D plot using an Axis3D object to display a line plotted with the ranges of 0 to 60 for each axis. Currently, the figure window does not display the axes or the data points, resulting in an empty graph. The expected behavior is to have a fully rendered 3D plot with visible axes and the plotted line.",
